I had the basil pasta, Ceasar salad and chocolate mousse cake for dessert. The food was delicious. Salad had fresh shaved cheese on it and the dressing wasn’t too fishy. As Ceasar can sometimes has the anchovy taste. The basil pasta was delicious, the grilled chicken in it was seasoned and cooked well. Chocolate mousse cake was amazing. Billy (who I believe is the owner) is funny and hospitable. He was joking with my\nFamily and myself. Great vibes! He was pleased to have us and Gave us hugs as we left. Very Italian of him, made me feel like family. Thank you for the delicious food and great service!"

They were giant, hearty, and full of incredible flavor. They were clearly made with care and authentic recipes, and they were a massive hit with all of our guests. Everyone was talking about them!\n\nIt is because of local businesses like Trattoria 35 that care deeply about our community that events like ours are possible. Their support helps us raise crucial funds for the vital work we do supporting women. This kind of generosity is exactly why I make a point to support businesses that give back.\n\nI highly recommend Trattoria 35. I will definitely be visiting their restaurant soon to show my support, and I encourage everyone to do the same. Thank you for your kindness and for making such a positive impact."

            "text": "Such a shame, this place used to be great back when I was younger.\n\nHot water had an off taste, either the cup wasnt cleaned properly or the metal leached into the hot water.\n\nSalad had a bit of sand, which is a minor issue so me and my party just ate/ignored it.\n\nOctopus dish was cooked okay.\n\nBread basket was good and warm.\n\nEntrees were inedible. They forgot our order and other tables were served ahead of my group (even though they arrived and ordered later). No1 came over to apologize, I had to make eye contact with a waiter to get a response, who said our food was coming. When the food came the waiter said the kitchen forgot our ticket. It looked like the kitchen rushed our entrees because of how bad it was. My pasta was served with so much extra liquid it was like soup. We compared it to the table next to us who got the same pasta, ours soup, theirs fine. The other entree had lukewarm rice but piping hot fried chicken. It looks like they scooped the rice and let it sit until the chicken was cooked.\n\nWhen they came to check up on us, I told them the issue. They said they would remake it, but it had already been a while and I had other plans afterwards. The manager, I think, came over and apologized. He said free coffee and dessert on the house, we said no as it was already night time, and how could dessert make up for inedible entrees? We just asked for the bill and left the food uneaten (minus the fried chicken).\n\nI would have appreciated them comping at least one entree but they didn't. By the time we were leaving and got to the front door, they said they would have done something to compensate us. Why didnt you offer to compensate a dish when you heard the issue at our table? I guess empty words are easier to offer when the guests are already leaving.\n\nAll in all, I shouldnt have come back looking for the good food I had in the past. This place would have been a good memory but know it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth."

Disgusting attitude from the server the whole time who can't help themselves but throwing attitude at paying customer.\n\nI suspect that it's because I'm an Asian woman that it happened. Despite making the reservation beforehand, they gave us the table at the innermost corner right by the bathroom. Just when we walked in. We hadn't disturbed anyone or anything but just when we walked in and the moment they saw our faces, they led us that table by the bathroom. There were other tables available. We asked the server if they could move us to a different table because it was so dark and we were there to celebrate a special occasion, the server flat out refused. The whole time, we felt berated by the server. I will never come back and tell all my family and friends to never visit this restaurant."

The other guests that were with me got the salmon, seabass, and chicken, and they all loved their food as well. Great wine and drinks selection.

Instead, he was met with pure condescension and outright disrespect by a staff member named Max. Without even asking what he was calling for, Max dismissively said: “The kitchen’s closed. It’s Father’s Day. Sorry for the inconvenience. Have a nice night,” and hung up the phone.\n\nHung up. On a customer. Mid-sentence.\n\nMy husband called back — not to argue — but simply to understand why he was abruptly disconnected. And the response? Max smugly declared: “I knew you would argue and I didn’t want to argue. It’s Father’s Day,” before hanging up again.\n\nThis is not just poor customer service — this is contempt for your customers. Max took it upon himself to close the restaurant early and treated a paying customer like an annoyance simply because he decided he didn’t feel like working anymore. Apparently at Trattoria 35, customers exist at the whim of whatever mood your staff happens to be in.\n\nLet’s be crystal clear:\n•\tYour posted hours are until 10 PM.\n•\tYour kitchen was open.\n•\tYour staff flat-out refused service, lied, and then handled it with arrogance and juvenile behavior.\n\nMax is the face of your restaurant tonight. His behavior was unprofessional, hostile, and completely unacceptable. If this is the type of person you allow to represent your business, it says everything anyone needs to know about the management behind the scenes.\n\nThere are dozens of far superior restaurants in this city where customers are treated with basic decency — something your staff apparently feels is optional. After tonight, Trattoria 35 is permanently off our list — and I’ll make sure anyone who asks knows exactly why.\n\nPathetic."

Then, we moved to our soups, tortellini in chicken broth for me and classic lentil for him. Just because I'm greedy, I also added fried mozzarella before our entrée.\n\nWe each paired our dishes with great wines, a German Reisling for me & a Sangria for him.

Everyone from the servers to the busboys (didn't see any female busgirls) were quick, efficient and friendly. Never had to ask for anything. It was automatically taken care of or refilled. This is the place to take anyone when you are looking to impress. Everything was cooked to perfection. Be sure to try the Stuffed mushroom appetizer as well as the Grilled Calamari. They were delicious."

We had the choice of salmon, chicken and steak.  I was quite impressed and compared to other places we have done events this place topped it. The service was very attentive. We had sit down dinner and the waiters took all meal requests and made sure every wine every water and every beer was full. I will definitely host another event here. It was a great venue."

Refills for bread  water & coffe came quickly. Bread was ok ,I will rather have a regular Italian bread with no seasoning instead of the one they served warm because I found it a little greasy. Starting with appetizers, the pasta fagiole was terrible. Beans were hard, no garlic flavor and was served with a brown sauce instead of white or red sauce as other restaurants. Calamari on sauce, spicy and very taste. Mozarella Carozza is totally different from other Italian restaurants. It's breaded & fried with roasted peppers ; it was ok for my liking. Now, entrees were a different story. Veal and  chicken marsala were delicious with very little meat ,lots of mushrooms  and a sauce to die for.The Chicken/Veal Capricioso were both also good. Rigatoni Gamberetti was good but smaller serving. Desserts Tiramisu  and creme Brulee were nice.Coffe it is strong. 5 people dinner came out to $221.54 plus tip.  It's a expensive restaurant. There is a bar were you can also eat and drink. Place is not small but only have 1 bathroom for men  and 1 for female , that is terrible, so prepare to wait. No requirements for mask or vaccine. There's also valet parking but there's always 1 available on streets near by."
