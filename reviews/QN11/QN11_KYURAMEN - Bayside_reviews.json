It looks much like the picture, the problem is the flavor is very \"mid\" at best. It lacked flavor. Another thing is the service,  they either need to hire more people or make sure their current servers are at the very least more attentive. They're polite and well mannered but it's clear they're swamped. I expected a seat at the bar I would at least have someone to check up on me and make sure I was getting more drinks as time went on but that wasn't the case. I get that this is a chain place, but for a chain place I expected things to go a little more smoothly."

            "text": "🍽️ Dinner at the Cute Little Restaurant\n\nI went to this really cute restaurant recently — the kind of place that just makes you smile when you walk in. The setup is adorable: cozy lights, neat decorations, and everything feels thoughtfully arranged. It’s the sort of spot that makes you want to stay a little longer, just to soak in the atmosphere.\n\nWhen the food arrived, it looked great. Nicely plated, colorful, and clearly made with care. I ordered a meat dish, which I was excited about — it looked juicy and tender at first glance. But once I tried it, I noticed the texture wasn’t quite as soft as I’d hoped. It was a little tougher than expected, and there was this faint smell that didn’t sit right with me. Not bad enough to ruin the meal, but definitely something that stood out.\n\nStill, the rest of the experience made up for it — the sides were flavorful, the service was friendly, and the price was very reasonable. It’s one of those places I’d probably give another try, hoping the next dish nails that perfect tenderness I was craving."

            "text": "Father daughter dinner date on a nice and cool Friday night. Ordered the new Beef Ramen, my daughter orders the Omurice. Guy takes the order, done. A few minutes later he says Omurice sold out so my daughter orders vegetable ramen. Beef ramen was good  my daughter likes it and I end up with the vegetable ramen. Didn't like the vegetable ramen so we called it a night. All of a sudden I notice they are serving omurice to another customer. I ask for the check and politely ask one of the servers, I saw an omurice served to another customer I thought it was sold out...explanations explanations...until the original server says \"I will have it done for you it's my mistake.: At first we didn't want it but hey if they are offering it, that's a good way to redeem the mistake. A tall man hands out the ipad for payment, once I sign he takes the ipad rudely, doesn't say a word after I paid, but brushed it off. 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min passed until the robot came with a bag, so we thought its the replacement omurice, but the tall man and a lady took it away, no explanation. And we waited and waited until no omurice and we had enough. I set a good example to my daughter didn't make a scene and just walked away. As we were walking out nobody cared, nobody said thank you, the workers pretended nothing happened. The worst part I still gave them an 18% tip. We support local business in Bayside but if the business doesn't give a damn about serving regular folks like me, we go somewhere else."

There was a robot delivering items to tables, which the kids liked.  Decent vibe.\n\nFood: ramen were fine.  Solid but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe spicy smashed cucumber salad was too fiery. I *like* heat in my cucumber salad but this was too much.  Couldn’t eat much of it.\n\nI had the signature tonkatsu omurice omelette which is served tableside.  It certainly looks dramatic, and the omelette is good… one of those dishes you would have real difficulties making at home.  However, the tonkatsu which came with it was a fatty, substandard piece of pork.\n\nThe kids had flavored lemonade which even they said was too sweet.\n\nService: wait staff are nice but several items we ordered never came out.  No one checked on us through the meal… we had to wave them over.\n\nOverall it’s a fun experience due to the restaurant design but the food and service could be better."

First time doing a large size group, so we were placed in the private seating and it was a wonderful set up. You have buttons that notify the servers that you are ready to order or need assistance, and they even have a robot that serves you meals and boba.\n\nThe tonkutso is decently good, not the best best I’ve ever had, but still very good for the price and experience. The rest of the food (non ramen) are soooo good, like the popcorn chicken. The boba is also soooooo good.\n\nGot the tote bag for my birthday."

We had the following dishes, HoneyComb platter, which was not tasty at all. Popcorn chicken was dried over cooked so was the tempura. Tempura had no taste , appeared to taste like Costco tempura. I also ordered the rice burger with fries, also tasteless, fries very salty. Beef Ramen was ok nothing to be thrilled about. It appears the cooking oil being used , has been used a number of times and not fresh. The service was mediocre, some were on their cell phone, had to call the waiter a number of times over for water. The ambiance was ok. The place is very clean as well as its bathroom. When paying the bill an automatic tip of 18% added. I travelled a lot and go to many restaurants to try different ethnic foods and consider myself a foodie who likes to rate the food, service and ambience to let other customers know how was the service. That is why I gave it a 1 star rating. I go to many Asian restaurants in NY and when I travel as well."

There was a different smell rather than pork broth. It was ok but you have to try it and taste for yourself. The omurice was not that good at all. They charged $26 for the egg, fried rice and small piece of fried pork cutlet along with choice of sauce and drink. Try it once to get a taste but would not recommend coming back here after once. Really expensive place. They also have a robot that bring out the take out order and bring the drinks to customer in seat. The layout is also different. They have small area of 2 people above the stairs. The service was ok. It took around 10 or more min to get our food. Before that we had to wait 25 min. I would recommend trying out this place at least once but not more than twice a year. It's not worth it. With the inflation and tariff and the economy I would not waste more than once at this place."

            "text": "Date of visit: April 29th — Honest Review\nof Kyu Ramen (Bayside, Queens)\n\nMy wife and I were looking forward to a simple ramen lunch, but unfortunately, this turned out to be one of our most disappointing dining experiences in recent memory.\n\nThe service felt rushed from the moment we sat down. I asked for a few more minutes with the menu, but the server returned in less than five minutes, which felt pushy. Not long after we got our food, we were handed takeout boxes without even being asked about dessert. It gave us the impression that they wanted to clear the table quickly, which made the whole experience feel unwelcoming.\n\nAs for the food itself, the portion sizes from Group B were quite small—especially considering the $18 price tag. Each bowl only had half an egg, and the broth tasted off, like it wasn’t fresh. We visited on a Tuesday, and honestly, the soup had an odd aftertaste.\n\nWorse, we realized both of our bowls had the same broth despite ordering different ramens: I had the Tokyo Tonkotsu and my wife ordered the Sapporo Miso. Hers tasted nothing like miso, and we suspect there may have been a mix-up in the kitchen.\n\nWe didn’t mention any of this to the staff because at that point, we just wanted to finish and leave. I’ve eaten at other ramen spots in Queens and expected more, especially based on the positive reviews.\n\nOverall, I’d rate this location 2 out of 5. I’m sure other branches might offer a better experience, but I personally wouldn’t go out of my way to return to this one.\n\nFull video review available on YouTube—search \"Worst Ramen experience nyc food review!\""
