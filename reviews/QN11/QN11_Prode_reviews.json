            "text": "Went there for dinner and honestly it was very sub par based off of the reviews. We ordered massaman curry, drunken noodles, and pork jowl over rice. Everything but the curry was barely warm telling me that it isn't made fresh and simply heated lightly in a microwave or something. The meat was to be supposedly grilled but has no flavor or texture, just that it was made prior and reheated in a microwave or something.\nThe atmosphere was nice and lively with a full house of people during peak dinner hours with no wait time. The service was a bit rushed but they were very  observant.\nPrices vary based on the protein and is the usual you'd see all over New York. Portion sizes are average.\nThe food itself tasted average with nothing to note. The menu however doesn't reflect the actual item ingredients."

The food is consistently delicious and full of authentic flavor. My absolute favorites are the crispy pork basil — perfectly seasoned with just the right kick — and the steamed whole fish with lime sauce, which is fresh, tangy, and packed with flavor. The staff are friendly and welcoming, and the service is always great. It’s a place I look forward to returning to every year!\n\nA trip to New York would not be complete without visiting Prode Thai restaurant. The food they serve is among the best I have had in the city. Today, I had their Pad Thai, Larb, grilled pork, steamed fish with lime sauce, and baked glass noodles with shrimp. All dishes were prepared and seasoned perfectly,"

I love minced pork basil over rice  with fried egg and this dish is my favorite now.\n\nMoreover, Duck pineapple curry is excellent with pineapple and lynchee which are good combination.\n\nWe get dessert aswell which is Trio topping with mango ice cream. They recommend to put peanut, plam seeds and cone with ice cream and eat all together. Whooo that is really good and  so yummy, freshly. 👏\n\nRecommend it 👍"

I’m a big fan of duck, so I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice with Duck and the Crispy Duck over Rice. Both dishes were excellent. The duck was perfectly crispy and flavorful.

No one came by to refill our water or take our order—we actually had to go up to the front desk to ask someone to come over. To make matters worse, they added a 20% service charge, even though that’s only supposed to apply to parties of six or more (we were five). After pointing this out, they did remove the charge, but overall the experience was disappointing."

My only (very small) complaint would be that tables are kind of placed very close with each other.  so if another person has to sit next to your table, that someone will be squeezing through tight spot between tables and be real close to your food. Most people would probably be ok, I'm just bit sensitive on things like this so it did bother me just a little bit. Luckily I went during non-peak hours, place was half empty so I was comfortable. By the time I was leaving, place quickly started to get filled up and I imagine when it's full, it you don't like sitting real close to other people, it may bother you. I can sense that this place has become real popular, looks like lot of returning customers and I can see why as I'll definitely be returning too. Easy to find street parking near the place."

            "text": "I recently visited this place with a friend. We originally planned to try their lunch special, but due to traffic we ended up going for dinner instead. We started with two appetizers: Thai dumplings and fried calamari. Both were delicious and generous enough to split between us. For mains, I ordered the crab meat fried rice, which was flavorful and satisfying. My friend went with the green curry chicken. She requested it mild, but it still came out quite spicy. She ended up ordering an extra side of rice to help balance the heat - though it came at an additional cost. To go with our meal, my friend ordered a glass of Prosecco, while I tried a cocktail called First Kiss, a fruity mix of different liquors. Both were enjoyable, but I found the drinks a bit overpriced for what they were. We finished with a unique dessert: a trio topping sampler featuring one scoop of mango ice cream with three toppings - nuts, corn, and palm seeds. It was refreshing and tasty, but again, the price felt high for the portion. We were charged $15 for the dessert, but when leaving, we noticed the paper menu by the door listed the dessert as $13. My recommendation is to update the printed materials so prices are consistent - otherwise, it doesn't look professional.\nThe atmosphere was calm, with quiet music by Pablo Cepeda playing in the background. It was pleasant and not loud, so we could enjoy our conversation and meal. Personally, I think Thai music would make the experience feel more authentic, but overall it was nice.\nService was excellent. Our waitress, Pang, was attentive, friendly, and quick to refill water or answer any questions. Even though the dining room was empty besides us (though plenty of people seemed to be picking up takeout which was a little bit distracting), she made us feel welcome and well taken care of.\nOverall, I would recommend Prode to anyone who enjoys Thai food. The flavors were on point, and the service was great. That said, I do think the drinks and dessert were overpriced. Still, it’s worth checking out and deciding for yourself."

It was super crowded but luckily after waiting around 5 minutes, we were able to be seated with the help of the staffs! We ordered quite a lot of food. I personally loved the crying tiger steak. It was marinated and grilled to perfection, a little red inside and super juicy. I really enjoyed wrapping the meat in lettuce and dipping it in the sauce. First time trying the Massaman curry and it was phenomenal too. I always like to end Thai meals with mango sticky rice and this one didn’t disappoint. Also, all the staffs are super friendly. My friend and I really enjoyed the whole dinning experience there. Hope to come back again soon and try the fish next time!"

Tucked along Northern Blvd, this place is a hidden gem that blends upscale vibes with home-style cooking. The decor is sleek and cozy, and the food? Legit Thai—herb-infused, flavorful, and beautifully plated.\nNow let’s talk about Naw—the host with the most. Naw is the kind of person who makes you feel like you’ve walked into a friend’s home. Friendly, attentive, and always smiling, Naw sets the tone for a dining experience that’s both elegant and welcoming. The entire staff follows suit—courteous, knowledgeable, and clearly passionate about what they do.\n\nNow let’s talk food. We went all in and every dish delivered:\n- Grilled squid – tender, smoky, and perfectly charred\n- Veggie combo – fresh, colorful, and balanced\n- Fried & crispy red snapper – golden, flaky, and packed with flavor\n- Spicy basil fried rice with shrimp – and yes, the shrimp were huge\n- Crying tiger steak – a massive plate of medium-cooked beef that melts in your mouth\n- Green curry with duck – rich, creamy, and deeply satisfying\n- Drunken noodle with fried tofu – bold, spicy, and full of texture\n- Bi Go Moi with ube ice cream – the first time I’ve ever drooled while eating\n- Yellow corner drink – strong and smooth, according to my wife (she knows her cocktails)\nThe restroom? Fancy and beautifully done. The bar? Fully stocked with top-shelf selections. And the best part? No wait times. You walk in, you eat like royalty, and you leave wondering why you haven’t been here sooner.\nIf you live anywhere near Little Neck, I’m challenging you to try it out. This place is a must.\n\nBoomsauce Scale:\n🗑️ B – basura (trash)\n😐 BS – basic (come on! Try harder)\n👍 BS + – better (Yo! That's better)\n🔥 BS ++ – best (alright! Alright! Alrightttt!)\n🌟 BS +++ – Amazing location! now that's boomsauce!\nTrust me—I am vegan."
