The drinks were too sweet, but the crispy fried pork was pretty good—especially with their sweet and sour dipping sauce, which was really tasty! The curry crab was decent, the sticky rice was just okay, and the sweet and sour mango fried fish was impressive if you’re capable of handling the spicy taste。As for the $10 mango ice cream, it was just so so."

Love the tom yum Kong soup, very rich in flavors. The mango sticky rice is also so good. Sampler of the appetizers was a perfect choice - you get to try in a deal. Must try this place if you are in the hood and love Thai cuisine, will definitely come back to try the other stuff."

The service was friendly and attentive. Thad the lychee sangria and old fashion. Both good. The old fashion had a Smokey taste and it was sweet and good."

Which is just a little spicy and rich in favor. Meat was tender. And the side salad included in the special was fresh leafy, onion, cucumber, shredded carrots, cherry tomato, two pieces tofu. Huge potion 😙\nI paid $18 for that.\n\nMy son ordered pad Thai and we shared the papaya salad which was fresh too.\n\nThis restaurant is small but not too crowded today at 2pm for late lunch ☺️\n\nPlease note that you do have to pay extra 3% if use credit card to pay"

I mostly opt for delivery but do dine in on special occasions. The ambiance is cozy and warm and the staff is very attentive. I've tried many items on their menu and there hasn't been a single item that disappoints. Flavors and textures are always well-balanced and perfectly spiced and their plating is impeccable! I don't eat meat and their menu has a good variety of vegetarian and seafood dishes. My personal favorites are Tom Yum soup, Drunken noodles with veggies, Green curry with tofu and jasmine rice, and mango sticky rice for dessert. My only complaint is their appetizer portions are a bit small and their menu is a little on the pricier side, however, the entrees are well portioned, the food is always fresh, and they don't skimp on ingredients so it's definitely worth the price. Highly recommend for dine-in or take-out!!"

The four of us ordered the fried tofu, Mock fish with baby bokchoy, Musamum curry with beef and roti, Pad thai and the fried pork hock.\nEverything was delicious. The sauces that came with the pork shoulder was beyond (wanting to buy some to bring home). Pad thai was good maybe a tad sweet for my taste. The Mock fish is quite fishy (unexpectedly) but textured like salmon...very interesting. The fried tofu was delish with the sauce. I like the texture of it\nOverall we enjoyed the meal."

The bar is well lit. Comfy chairs & liquors on display. It's very social media friendly. The server / host was very welcoming. It was a Wednesday night and wasn't packed. So, we had our choice of seating.\n\nDrinks: We ordered two thai iced teas - Yummy. Not overly sweet. Nice and cold. There was a Thai Iced Tea Float but unfortunately it wasn't available to try. I'll be going back for this.\n\nThere is a vast selection of well know classic Thai dishes and some not so know (at least to me) but they all look delicious.\n\nAppetizers: We ordered the shrimp cake. It was tasty with the plum sauce and on it's own a 5/10 with the sauce 8.5/10\n\nEntrees: I ordered the Beef Stew & my wife got the minced pork fried rice.\n\nBeef Stew with vermicelli noodles was fantastic. It was aromatic, fresh, and visually appealing. The spices reminded me of a dish called Pepper pot. The beef was tender and flavorful. The beef balls were tender and juicy. I loved the pepper infused broth. I would enjoy this on a cold winter day.\n\nMinced Pork Fried Rice: Perfectly seasoned. A nice spicy kick. Pork was nice and not fatty. Well balanced flavors. The runny egg on the rice was *chefs kiss.*\nMy wife really enjoyed it.\n\nPortions are good. If you're hungry you'll be satisfied.\n\nParking in this neighborhood is decent but gets busy in the afternoon.\n\nI can't wait to go back & try their Crab Omelette"

I tend to order in alot but recently the delivery apps have been taking too long. decided to go in person and the food was so good. the drunken noodles are perfectly chewy and the sauce is delicious. the som tum (papaya salad) is one of my favorites! it comes with pork rinds, so i recommend asking them to take it off if you don’t like it. i personally didn’t finish the spring rolls, you can tell that they’re well made and they’re super crispy, but there’s not much filling."
