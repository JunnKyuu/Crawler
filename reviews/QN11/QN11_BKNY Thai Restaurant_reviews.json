One of the happiest moments in our lives that we got to share with all our friends and family. We are so thankful for the wonderful staff that went above and beyond to make our night special. Food was amazing as always, ambiance was perfect and everyone working there was so kind and accommodating. Thank you again! Looking forward to making more memories in this place either it be big or small."

The staff hustles and they work very well as a team. No staff member stands around.  If they’re not serving they’re preparing setups or cleaning.\n\nStarted with the Dumplings. One of my favs.  Soft and silky with the best flavors.  Four never seems to be enough. Little pillows of joy in your mouth.\n\nNext to the muscles. Chose mild as I’m a lightweight with heat.  While they weren’t as good as the last time I was here the broth they are in made up for it.  I actually poured this sauce over my dumplings and it was yummy!\n\nStuck traditional with pad tai which never disappoints and an order of crispy duck which was tender and flavorful as always. Good was served hot with little wait time.\n\nThere’s many Thai places in flushing but I like this place better than most because it’s spacious and clean and has some ambiance.  It’s more of a dining experience compared to some of the smaller places where you are cramped and pushed in and out."
