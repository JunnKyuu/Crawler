I was surprised at the wide range of options, from seafood to Mexican to Korean-inspired dishes on their menu.\n\nI enjoyed the diversified music they had in there, seamlessly switching for rap from the 2010s to present, to dembow. The music wasn’t too loud, which is a great plus.\n\nOur server was kind and understanding, never got upset when we changed our order or when one of our party members was late. He also ended up giving us a free shot lol. He was very sociable and chill.\n\nThe prices are also fair and this is the ONLY place I’ve been to in NYC that still sells tacos by threes. It’s the little things like that, bc I’m tired of places that sell one taco for $5+.\n\nOverall, it’s a great chill vibe. Not too fancy, which is good bc I prefer a casual vibe. I recommend!"

I had seen them on social media before and wondered if it was actually good or one of those overhyped spots. It's actually really good! I started off with an empress gin cocktail. Love that gin. It's purple and looks really cool and the drink tasted good as well. It was garnished with lychee and an orange. For food I did the mix and match tacos for $15 and chose their bulgogi cheesesteak, chicken teriyaki and fish tempura. They also have chopped cheese and a vegan option, but both are not available for the mix and match option. All the tacos were good, but the bulgogi cheesesteak was my favorite. I'm pretty sure I would like the chopped cheese as well if I ordered them. Love a good cheesy beef combo. I also ordered the Cajun waffle fries which were really good. They're served with chipotle aioli and are really crispy and flavorful. I sat at the bar and the bartender was really attentive and friendly. Overall, it was a fun experience and you should definitely check it out if you're in the area."

They also showcase a great selection of happy hour cocktails- including espresso martinis, frozen margs, a mule, a showstopper of a lycheetini, A BEER TOWER, and a few more!\nThe atmosphere always gives me a sense of home. The playlist played throughout the night always has some great old school hits, Hispanics mixes, and R&B goodies. And the staff takes care of us as if we were their own family every single time we are here. We’ve had amazing servers and bartenders throughout every encounter, one that has stood out amongst our very first visit till our most recent is Glenn, a super personable manager and a spot-on bartender!\nI’m not from the city and this place is the greatest spot to go hangout, drink good drinks, eat good food, and vibe out till the night is over.

Change your chef immediately! I ordered the steak and eggs, medium rare. He sent out a well done steak. I tried to eat it because the bar tender (Christa)  was so apologetic and I never like sending anything back. The steak had this burnt taste so I had no choice but to send it back. THEN, they give me the replacement and the steak was literally uncooked. I added pictures so people don’t think im lying. At this point I was upset because why are you cooking in a restaurant if you can’t even cook the basic. The staff said they would recook it. They sent it back out, and the steak was still undercooked and had no flavor and just gross. I ate a little and just left it. So over it. Will NEVER come back here unless the chef changes. Literally spent $70 for NOTHING. The last picture is when I gave up on eating."

After 30mins it got so packed (all seats taken) with a line at the door. I guess everyone knew this was the spot expected me 😆. You would not regret it, the food is very tasty. The mimosas were also great. For 4 ppl with tip came up to $225. It's very affordable. We also took a cake with us because we had a bday person. They kept the cake until we was ready to celebrate. The music was nice as well. You can sit inside or outside. (No parking but there is a cheap parking lot close by for 8$ per hour I think)."

My bill was only 52 and auto gratuity plus tax brought it to 73. Not disclosing that your bill will include automatic gratuity is extremely dishonest to me. Especially if it’s 20%!!

There was a hair in one of the dishes we ordered. We sent it back and advised we did not want anything else besides what we already ordered or a brand new dish. They proceeded to charge us STILL for the dish that was untouched with HAIR embedded in the sauce stuck to the shrimp.\n\nWhoever these new owners are need to get it together, cuz this is not the service or food we are used to."

My friend and I went after brunch hours where things were already slow and not much happening. They told us they were cleaning our table and once they cleaned it they forgot to seat us, they finally realized and told us we can walk over and sit there.. After the arrival of our food I had to mention that they forgot our drink orders after we realized no one was at the bar making our drinks. They did genuinely apologize and they gave us complimentary shots... The shots tasted like bubbly soda. The chicken skewers were not great at all, they were undercooked and I saw some pink after I had already bit into one. And my pork slider was extremely greasy. Their wings however was nicely cooked and crispy and had a great taste. We did have to also ask for our check twice since the first time the waiter completely forgot. He did apologize and feel extremely bad and even gave us a discount on our check, which we really did appreciate. Overall I honestly think that they just had an off day, which can happen. I do like the fact that they were sincere in their apology, and they were trying."

There was a small group of about 6 women there and the restaurant rating on the door was a C (YIKES). But I didn't want to upset the hubby especially after dragging him out of the house to go there. I am very happy that I stuck it out, we both ordered wings and they were good would have been great if they were fried just a tad more and if the ones that I got were a lot more spicy (strong warning that  said \"eat at your own risk\"). We both had the steak and eggs I had mines  with home fries (could take a few tips from a southerner, but not bad) hubby had his with the tater tots. Over all we had a great time and it wasn't expensive at all (2 apps, 2 entrees, and 3 top shelf drinks with tax $100) in NYC."

            "text": "Came here on Taco Tuesday to get the three taco special.\n\nWe ordered the bulgogi beef, fish tempura and the shrimp tempura. The bulgogi beef was a little too salty and the fish tempura sort of got soggy if you didn't eat that one first. The shrimp tempura was probably the better of the three but it felt like it was missing something, not sure but maybe a tangy sauce?\n\nWe shared the SET loaded tots as our appetizer and we're glad we did. It was pretty heavy itself, specially with the bulgogi beef on top. It could go without it, but I like beef so having that with the tots were a good combo.\n\nI really liked the spacious layout, it didn't feel packed with tables that you couldn't walk around and the seating area was comfortable. The staff were super friendly and helpful, always checking up to see if you're doing okay.\n\nDefinitely a spot to try if you want a space to hang out for happy hour while enjoying some finger food."
