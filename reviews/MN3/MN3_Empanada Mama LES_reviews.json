I did have to pull off half of the cheese on it bc it was way too much, but that’s just personal preference. Our server was very kind and informative when it came to ordering.\n\nI have celiac so I asked if the wheat and corn empanadas shared a fryer and sadly they do, so no empanada for me.\n\nI noticed after the fact that the arepa was also fried, so I’m not sure if those share a fryer as well. I took gluten-ease and an allergy pill preemptively, so I’ll update if there’s any noticeable adverse effects for my fellow celiacs.\n\nThey have plenty of non-fried options too just fyi!\n\nEdit: I did feel a little weird after the arepa, so best to just avoid the dried food if you have a strong sensitivity/cealiac."

Coming from central NY where we lack Empanada mama's its a wonderful city treat my go to is the Viagra which is a seafood filled Empanada, the reggaeton Empanada always hits as well as the El Toro, I won't lie I don't think you can pick a wrong one but dont forgotto add the green sauce it will change your life. Don't forget to grab the mango juice to pair with it and you will be thanking us later."

It’s easy to order ahead online, use the kiosks in-store, the take-out counter, or have a seat for table service, including a bar. I’ve never had a bad experience, at any location, since I started going regularly over 5 years ago. Everything is full-flavor from food to sauces.\n\nThe Buffalo Chicken Empanada is the best way to eat buffalo chicken. It is one of their fried wheat varieties. The outside is crispy, thin and light and the inside is packed, as full as possible, with shredded buffalo chicken. The empanada breading gives way to a pleasing crunch. The chicken is soft with a sweet, savory, and spicy flavor. It is already so delicious that you don’t need a sauce, but it comes with one that balances everything with a creamy tanginess that ups the flavor.\n\nThe Banana Nutella Empanada is one of my favorites - one of their baked wheat varieties. It is topped with cinnamon and sugar that gives a caramelized and crispy outside. The center is filled with warm Nutella and a banana. It’s very fun to eat.\n\nThey have over 40 varieties of empanadas. They serve baked wheat and fried wheat and corn empanadas. They are a first-floor, store-front with no stairs to enter or dine. The decor and atmosphere are bright and exciting. It can get loud during busy hours."

I’m disappointed with the quality and taste of the food at Empanada Mama.\n\nI ordered two empanadas as you can see in the images: Beef Empanada made with corn flour and Cheese empanada made with white flour.\n\nThe wait time for the empanadas was longer than anticipated. Personally I’d like to think the wait time was longer because of the quality so I could live with up to 10 minutes of waiting :).\n\nHowever, I unfortunately did not enjoy my empanadas as I’d hoped. Firstly, my cheese empanada was like any cheese “pastelito” since (as seen in pictures) this was really mostly air than empanada. Secondly, my cheese was marked with some kind of ink. (Seen in pic). I would appreciate it if were informed of what this is?\n\nMy beef empanada made with corn flour was unfortunately not much better. I did not enjoy the taste of the beef and the mixture of tomato sauce or seasoning it had. The corn flour base was interesting and personally new for me, but it was honestly not an empanada I enjoyed eating.\n\nI do appreciate the man who took my order. He answered my questions and gave me recommendations.\n\nIt is unfortunate but I do not see myself ordering from any Empanda Mama moving forward. It wasn’t a pleasant experience."

One of their new employees who tends the bar, Daniel, was an absolute angel. Because of him, I wound up getting one of their Nutcracker frozen drinks… By the way, they are AMAZING! If he didn’t upsell me like you should do in a business, I would’ve left there with only what I had ordered in the beginning. Thank you Daniel for making my experience so nice! And Evan, you are the absolute man! Best manager of a restaurant I’ve ever met, and I worked in food service for many years. I hope to see both of you again my next visit.

The wait time was extremely long for just empanadas to come out and to my surprise the manager was not welcoming at all! My food took so long to come out that I decided to sit inside to eat and I was told by the manager who was sitting and eating at a table next to me (in regular clothes) that I can’t sit there because tables are only for indoor dining. He didn’t even introduce himself as an employee so it was a very awkward interaction. I asked if he worked there and said, are you really going to make me leave? I ended up staying but what also struck me was that the manager himself did not even wipe his table down after getting up from eating, when all of the tables have a sign that says they’ve been sanitized. No employee cleaned it.  AND I found a small hair in my flan."

They just kept lying. The chownow app stated that this restaurant uses their own delivery drivers so they could not do anything about it nor cancel or refund. This is the absolute worse place to order delivery. Additionally, the food was cold, egg had a shell, and avocado looked awful. Never again."

            "text": "We were sat at a decent time. Me and my friend order brunch items. I ordered steak and eggs and he ordered pancakes. My dish came and his didn’t. After 30 minutes his pancakes still never came as my food was getting cold sitting in front of me waiting for his. It was hard to get our servers attention. So I had to get up and find her to find out the kitchen skipped his order. I found the server printing out a receipt of our food to go back to kitchen with it. They looked at the ticket like they never received it. We then waited another 15 minutes with still no food. After trying to get the servers attention again we asked her for a to go box for my food and drinks to go and the bill b/c we were just over it at this point….. she couldn’t even bring us that. Again, we got up to find her. Again, they brought out just one drink and had to wait about 10 minutes for the next one. When making orders why do it partially? I never got my to go box so I had to leave my food. The server decided to only charge us for the 2 drinks & as we were leaving the pancakes finally came out and we just took them to go.\n\nLastly I wanted to add that there should be NO REASON a baby is at the bar! I brought it to security’s attention and I don’t think he understood English and I brought it to our servers attention & she said “oh that’s not my baby” like girl I know that … The baby should not be at the bar!\n\nPoor service very disappointed . The steak I had was wayyy too chewy …"

            "text": "I was really happy to find this 24hr spot on my last day in NYC. It was perfect for a quick brunch by the hotel before heading to the airport. They have three vegan empanadas: portobello, rice & beans, and veggie. I got the lunch special for $12.50 which includes your choice or two empanadas with a side of rice and beans. The veggie empanada was my favorite. The filling reminded me a bit of a pot pie. The portobello Empanada was really good also. The mushroom flavor came through strongly and was pretty meaty. It's nice to have 24hr vegan options!"

            "text": "First time dropping in and noticed the huge assortment of empanadas available. The list is pretty long so you can spend a good amount of money trying out different flavors during your visit or multiple visits. Picked up 5 of them which where all very unique and flavorful. The best one I ordered was the one called viagra which came with shrimp and some other seasoning making it the perfect combination for a non meat empanada even after reheating at home. If they offered a bit of a combo deal when you ordered a group of empanadas that would help offset the cost."

They also have a window for take out that you can wait inside. The service was good and the girls were really nice. In general it could be a little bit cheaper in my opinion!"

Pero el servicio no me gustó mucho porq fui como turista a new York y primera vez q visitaba el restaurante, hice mi pedido por una computadora que tienen en la pared y luego q me siento a esperar me informan y la mesera no me puede atender porq le tenía q pedir la comida a ella. Igual dejamos propina! Pero tengan en cuenta ese detalle."

Subtracting 2 stars because it's very overpriced for counter service: came out to $20 for 4 medium sized empanadas which are just about enough to fill a hungry person up."

In all 5 boroughs.  I think I’ve found one food truck in Queens and another restaurant that was in Jersey.\n\nI had the lunch special which was 2 empanadas with rice and beans.  One empanada was ground beef and the other was the Viagra which is a shrimp empanada.\n\nBoth delicious with the green and red sauces."
