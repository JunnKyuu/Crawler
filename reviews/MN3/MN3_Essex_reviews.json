The place itself is lovely, spacious with bar seating, table seating, making it perfect for a solo visit, a date night, or hanging out with friends.\n\nThe food was fantastic and full of flavor. The fried calamari was crispy and came with a delicious sauce. The rice and chicken skewers were absolutely tasty. I also loved the pineapple cake, it had the perfect balance of sweet pineapple and also tasted cornbread flavor too, but it was good and moist.\n\nI’m not much of a drinker, but the Mango Lava Lamp drink was really good! This spot is a winner and I’ll definitely be coming back, whether solo, on a date, or with friends."

I paired it with a refreshing fruit cocktail, a mix of citrus and berry notes that matched the dish beautifully. The sweet and sour tones of both the food and drink complemented each other perfectly! The atmosphere was lively yet cozy a great weekend vibe with friendly staff and upbeat music. Service was quick and attentive, and my glass never went empty. Highly recommend Essex if you’re into bold, flavorful brunches with creative drinks."

It was tough and just not really edible. The service was astounding and they kindly replaced my entree with the branzino which is what I should have ordered in the first place. Truly, it was astounding. Outside of restaurant week, I don’t think we could really justify the price for what we got, but everything was delicious. The staff was impeccable. The vibes are a good instagram moment."

            "text": "(Last visited September 4, 2023.) Hanging out in New York City for Labor Day weekend and it's time to brunch! So today we're on the lower east side and checking out Essex! Here's how it went...\n\nAtmosphere/Appearance: This place is pretty big for a New York restaurant! It's elongated like most of them but it also has an upstairs! It's very elegant, chic and felt like, historic... maybe? Like, set back in the day a little bit. It was on the quieter side, but still felt energetic as we sat right at the bar near the door since it was so busy.\n\nService: We sat at the bar and we were well taken care of. I can't remember who took care of us, but they had our mimosas FULL-FULL. Like, with a meniscus on top. Lol. Serious stuff.\n\nFood: I went with the Angus strip and salad which was decent. It could've used some more seasoning or salt, but the steak was cooked well and the salad felt healthy. It was filling, but didn't make me regret eating it. Lol. Most importantly, the mimosas just flowed and flowed. Bottomless was done to perfection here, that's why it's important to sit right at the bar! At the source! Lol.\n\nValue: It's New York City and it's a nice restaurant. It's not going to be cheap. I think my wife and I spent just over $100.00 with tax and tip for each of us to have bottomless mimosas then our entrees. Totally worth it.\n\nIn conclusion, I liked it here and would totally come back! Check this place out if you're in the area."

            "text": "I discovered ESSEX after a long and challenging workday while searching for a healthy, delicious meal during NYC Summer Restaurant Week—and I am so glad I did! The restaurant has a wonderful vibe: inviting, modern, and relaxing, perfect for unwinding after a busy day.\n\nI started with the roasted baby heirloom carrots, and they were absolutely refreshing and full of flavor. The combination of sunflower seeds, hummus, and the delicate sweetness of the carrots created a perfect balance—light yet satisfying.\n\nFor my main course, I chose the French cut organic chicken breast, which completely exceeded my expectations. It came with roasted peaches, an unexpected touch that blended beautifully with the savory flavors. Every bite felt thoughtfully crafted and memorable.\n\nEven though I don’t usually eat dessert, I couldn’t resist trying the tahini butternut panna cotta after seeing it at another table. It was not overly sweet, just perfectly balanced, and the rich tahini flavor with the chocolate crumbles on the side took it to another level. It was a unique and delicious way to end my meal.\n\nA special shout-out to my waiter, Juan (J-U-A-N). He was incredibly knowledgeable, attentive, and kind, making my experience even more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, ESSEX is a gem—I left feeling happy, satisfied, and already hoping to return soon. Highly recommended for anyone looking for creative, healthy, and flavorful dining in New York City!"

I got my drink & water before they arrived several minutes later. Water glasses were quickly filled and the waiter came by again to take drink and food orders. We started with the oysters, unfortunately, they were a bit small and not so tasty -  was not a fan of the sauces provided. I would probably try this again as it’s not really the season for oysters right now. The shrimp wantons was a table favorite, as was the calamari. The flatbread was small and just Ok. We ordered a second round of food as it was our dinner. The Manchego mac and cheese was outstanding! It was probably the best Mac n cheese I’ve had at a restaurant with a healthy amount of cheese and perfectly prepared with a toasted top. The 3 of us were almost full but we managed to finish the very good truffle fries. I probably wouldn’t order the roasted peppers next time, even though they were prepared excellently. All the food arrived piping hot, which should be easy to do but most places don’t do this. The place was buzzy with people drinking but there was still room if you wanted to drink, arrive early for a table. Fantastic happy hour! Oct 2024"

The food at Essex was mindblowingly delicious! The sides were 10/10! So much so that I wish I’d eaten less so I could have fully finished the perfectly cooked steak. So so good. Great dinner to end a perfect night of birthday celebrations."

The mixed drinks were superb. I would like to see some other beers on the menu that are not draft choices. Keep up the good work, I'll be back."

You can’t go wrong with any of them! The oysters were only $2 each and it was even happy hour price or anything which is so hard to come by nowadays, the app and steak was superb! The desserts were great too but the dinner was just so good that that’s what left us wanting to go back!"
