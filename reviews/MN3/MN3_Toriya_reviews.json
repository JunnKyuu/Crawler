            "text": "Came for lunch with my friend earlier this week and it was great. We got both the lunch special (I got the oyakodon with kara-age and he got the gyudon with sweet potato fries) as well and some skewers and beer. They run a happy hour from 12 to 6 pm which is great if you like Japanese beer (and I do). There also a complimentary miso soup at the beginning of the meal. All the food was good (the kara-age was portioned into larger piece than I'm used to but it was still juicy and tasty) and big portions on the rice bowls. You can get the skewers grilled with salt or tare and they come with a wedge of lemon you can squeeze over it. If you do get skewers, I recommend eating them ASAP because they cool off quicker than the rest of the food (not their fault or anything, just the nature of it).\n\nThere was only one waiter who doubled as the hostess while we ate (it was pretty quiet when we were there, but it's probably busier during dinner and the weekend) and service was quick and friendly. They also run some promotion where if you can stop a big stopwatch at exactly 8.88 seconds you get your meal free but we stopped too early at 8.73. Music was audible (mostly kpop and jpop/rock I think) but not overwhelming and you can still hold a conversation. Seems like a great place for a date, casual dinner, or just chilling after work so I'd definitely come again"

Gyoza arrived underdone. Salmon rice was clumpy and dull. Flavors blurred together. The lunch special set this place apart from the many strong new Japanese spots in the neighborhood. Without it, and without the sharper execution it once had, it risks fading into the crowd."

The yakitori was absolutely top-notch—each skewer grilled to perfection with that delicious smoky flavor you can only get from a proper charcoal grill. You can really taste the quality.\n\nI also loved the small plates and sides—they reminded me of meals I had in Japan. Everything felt thoughtfully prepared, from the seasoning to the presentation. Even something as simple as the miso soup or tsukune (chicken meatball skewer) was full of flavor and care.\n\nThe atmosphere was relaxed but had that intimate Tokyo izakaya feel. The staff were super knowledgeable and made some great recommendations.\n\nIt’s rare to find a place that feels this genuine. Toriya is the real deal—delicious, authentic, and totally worth a visit!"

We were served quickly and the food was good. They allowed us to get one more order in before the kitchen closed but did not rush us. The lychee lemonade was delicious I highly recommend. I recommend getting everything with the Tare sauce. It’s a bit dry on its own. Everything was juicy and crispy. I would definitely go back. We didn’t try any bowls or other dishes but it may have been because we went late at night. Would like to try more Japanese dishes."

This is the real deal with proper matcha intensity and complexity.\n\nThe minimalist aesthetic perfectly matches the thoughtful, authentic food. Prices that make regular visits possible (shocking for NYC), and quality that rivals places charging twice as much.\n\nA standout in LES that actually delivers on both authenticity and value.

While smaller, Toriya delivers an equally impressive experience.\n\nVenturing through the Lower East Side, I stumbled upon this hidden gem, tucked away from the usual hustle. Toriya's exterior boasts a humble charm with a wooden door and simple decor. Stepping inside, however, reveals a surprisingly chic space. Neon signs bathe the room in a vibrant nightlife atmosphere, complemented by upbeat music.\n\nAs an Izakaya-style restaurant, Toriya specializes in small plates, perfect for sharing. We eagerly dug into a selection of their offerings.\n\nFirst up, the fried squid: Presented with artistic flair, the squid fanned out like an Asian fan and arrived drizzled with a delicious mayo-soy sauce. A fantastic start!\n\nNext, the Yakisoba: This classic dish featured stir-fried noodles tossed with sliced pork, cabbage, and finished with a flourish of bonito flakes. Simply fantastic.\n\nThe fried eggplant: This dish offered a delightful textural contrast between the juicy eggplant and the crunchy panko coating. Irresistible!\n\nBeef Tongue: Oh. My. God. This is a must-try! (Note: Budget friendly, YEah!.)\n\nMentaiko Sausage: A first for me, this sausage packed a flavorful punch, especially when paired with the accompanying mayo and cucumber. This one deserves all five stars!\n\nSlider: This miniaturized Tonkatsu burger, while tasty, was a bit on the small side and slightly difficult to eat due to its construction. Still, the flavor shone through.\n\nSteamed Clams: Fresh and juicy, these clams weren't overly watery and came beautifully garnished with scallions and thinly sliced chili. Delicioso!\n\nSkewers Galore: The skewer selection offered a delightful variety: grilled pork, meatballs, chicken gizzards, eggplant, bacon, and the list goes on!\n\nToward the End. While I can't recall every single dish due to the sheer volume of deliciousness, I left Toriya with a satisfied and happy belly. This hidden gem will definitely be on my top list for future Lower East Side explorations.\n\nHighly recommended!"

You should have just told me you haven't been to Japan, haha.\n\nIt's essentially just skewers, typically chicken skewers but has expanded to all types of meats and veggies.\n\nMy big bro and I walked into Toriya like Godzilla and King Kong ready to DESTROY some skewers. We can both EAT.\n\nAfter walking through a chic minimalist Japanese exterior, the interior was kind of odd. Super dim lighting to the point where I had to turn my phone flashlight on to read the menu like a geriatric, but also had a bunch of neon signs on the walls and music BLASTING. I prefer a much chiller vibe for my Yakitori, but to each their own. Personal preference is beautiful.\n\nWe went CRAZY. In total, we got 22 skewers and 10 piece gyoza that was actually some of the best I've had this year. See attached pic of that gyoza for your own mental health.\n\nThe skewers come spaced out one after the other, and you can easily order more as you go which is idyllic. Our favorite skewers were the Kushikatsu Meatballs with tare sauce and the chicken thigh, with the least favorite being the short rib. $12 for a tiny little skewer of mid rib was not worth it.\n\nAfter demolishing everything because we are soldiers of god, the damage totaled up to $125 before tax and tip. No drinks or anything either so lowkey kind of expensive, but also we did get a lot of food so...\n\nI'll be back mostly due to the quality of food and how late they are open. This would be a solid place to pop your Yakitori cherry, although I am still looking for a Yakitori spot to really hang my hat on in NYC.\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

Everything i ask about and get recommended turns into my favorite dish. I’ve been coming here since last fall (October 2023) and try to make it a point to come here whenever I’m in the area. The yakitori is very consistent and perfectly grilled, all the dishes are portioned bigger than what you’d get in other yakitori spots.\n\nI definitely recommend going for the skewers of your choice to start or just jump into their massive share dishes like the karaage, okonomiyaki, and tteokbookgi (spicy rice cakes). I can keep going with their entire menu since I’ve been here enough to have tried everything, but I can honestly say, there wasn’t a dish I did not enjoy. I’m also saying this as I have just came back from Japan! If I miss the food I had during my trip, I can come back here anytime.\n\nThe decor, theme, vibes from the atmosphere is also perfect. Reminds me of hitting up some late night underground spots out in Osaka, except much roomier. Give the place a try if you’re in LES, you won’t regret it!"

The ambiance is perfect: neon soaked interior, paper lanterns, and lively guests.  Very up-beat music, really feels like you're \"going out\". I'll absolutely come back, this place is awesome!"

We got one of the booth table in the back and it feels like we are in Japan. We love the pork belly volcano stew and the kimchi pork with tofu. Must try are their dumplings! Highly recommended!"
