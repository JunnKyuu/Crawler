The noodles were firm with a unique flavor, likely from a different flour blend, and stood out from any ramen I’ve had before. The broth also had a creative twist that felt light and clean without losing depth. I had the spicy miso and i think there is mala in there.. the different spice profile is well balanced.It’s a great example of how you can deviate from tradition and still deliver something just as satisfying as the original. Service is good - the staff is very attentive. Restaurant lighting is a little too dim imo."

            "text": "(Last visited June 4, 2023.) Hanging out in NYC with some friends and we were on the lower east side this time. We were walking down the street and the incredible umami smell of ramen wafted our noses so we decided on Ivan Ramen! Here's how it went.\n\nAtmosphere/Appearance: This place may look a little small, but there's a lot of space in here in separate compartments. It was SUPER busy so we did have to wait a little bit, but it wasn't too bad. It was nice outside so we actually went IN to the restaurant then out like, a side door to another outdoor section that was so beautifully setup. It was quieter outside (naturally) and just felt nice to eat outdoors, but not be sitting right next to the street.\n\nService: I can't remember who took care of us, but I don't remember having any issues at all.\n\nFood: We started off with their Wagyu Pastrami Buns which is a concoction of house-made pastrami, sauerkraut and japanese-russian dressing. These were delightful! Rich, meaty, creamy and a lil' crunchy due to the sauerkraut. Well-executed. We then tried Ivan's Karaage which is crispy fried chicken, lemon, and choice of sauce: yuzu-kosho mayo, black garlic honey, shiso buttermilk, or yuzu-chili sauce. Of course we went with the yuzu-kosho and this too was delightful! Crispy, crunchy, tender chicken that was rich in flavor! For my ramen/bowl entree I decided on the Triple Pork Triple Garlic which is a less soup-y style of ramen made with a tonkotsu broth, shoyu-braised pork chashu in two ways. My goodness this was off the chain! Hot, tender pork, rich, salty broth and excellent balance with textures. Well-done.\n\nValue: It's New York City. I mean, you know the deal. Each of our appetizers were $14.00 and my ramen was $20.00. Not bad at all to be completely honest. That's extremely reasonable and worth every penny!\n\nIn conclusion, I'd absolutely pull up here again and get these exact things! Of course I'd love to try some other menu items as well! Check this place out if you can get a seat!"

Thanks to a friend for bringing us here and encouraging us to watch the Chef's Table episode featuring Chef Ivan Orkin—a moving story that resonates deeply and is worth watching (grab a tissue and watch before you go!)\n\nWe went on a night when the Blackbird special was going on, and the ramen was half-price through the app. We ran into some issues with the app, but luckily a representative was there to help. Even though we couldn't get the app working correctly, Ivan Ramen still honored the deal. Great service!\n\nIvan Orkin's dedication to creating a unique culinary experience distinctly shines through in the food. The ramen I enjoyed was absolutely the best I've ever had, even compared to my time in Japan. I savored the chicken ramen, enhanced by roasted tomato, and it was nothing short of spectacular.\n\nAccompanying the ramen, we had a delightful serving of the Ivan Karaage, which was beautifully crispy and flavorful—a true highlight of the meal. On our plates but not pictured were the scrumptious miso Caesar salad and a refreshing daikon salad, both of which complemented the meal perfectly.\n\nEverything about our dining experience was exceptional, and I can't recommend Ivan Ramen enough for anyone looking to enjoy an authentic yet innovative take on ramen!\n\nUpdate: had to go back again, added some more photos."

From the deeply flavorful Triple Pork Triple Garlic Mazemen to the lighter yet satisfying Tokyo Shoyu Ramen, every dish is crafted with precision, personality, and top-tier ingredients. The noodles are springy and fresh, the broths rich and layered, and the small plates, like the tofu caviar and fried chicken buns, offer playful, delicious surprises. The vibrant, casual atmosphere and genuinely enthusiastic staff create a welcoming vibe that makes the meal even more enjoyable. While it's a bit of a splurge, the quality and inventiveness more than justify the price. Ivan Ramen isn’t just a good ramen shop, it’s a must-visit culinary destination in NYC."

The pork ramen was also excellent, showcasing the versatility of the kitchen.\n\nThe restaurant's thoughtful approach to traditional Japanese cuisine with innovative touches makes it a must-visit destination.

Would highly recommend the spicy garlic chicken appetizer as well as the combo where you can get 3 small bites for $16 - the potato salad was the best I’ve had and the asparagus with the stracciatella changed my life.\n\nHowever, the hostess was rude and unfriendly - told us there was a 45 min wait, when we went back (put our names down), she told us we were next. When a table cleared a few minutes later, she sat down another group that had also been waiting while ignoring us. So, it ended up being about 75 minutes to get seated… And then we didn’t even get a table, but rather the bar/stool seating. That aside, the service (our waiter) was speedy and lovely.\n\nOverall would come back but recommend MAKING A RESERVATION, even for weekdays!"
