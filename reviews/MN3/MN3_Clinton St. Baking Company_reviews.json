He was happy, friendly, attentive and helpful- well above the usual service norms.\nafter receiving our order and getting us our drinks, he apologized and informed us that his shift was finished and we will be waited on by another waiter. We thanked him and wished him a wonderful evening.\nUnfortunately, the next waiter was a disaster. She was abscent and barely acknowledged us - more concerned looking at her phone while talking to another employee.\nThe food was good. The atmosphere was a lively Diner experience, but the second waiter(ess) ruined the dining experience.\nOne of the few times I didn't leave a tip.\n(I debated with myself if I should of given at least 2 stars for Service - maybe 3 considering how good the first waiter was - but I just bring myself to give more than 1 after the experience with the second waiter(ess) - sorry."

Hashbrowns were more like crispy home fries. The bacon was ehh so definitely ask for the bacon to be crispy.\n\nThe drinks though were amazing.

            "text": "If there’s one NYC spot that truly lives up to its breakfast reputation, it’s Clinton St. Baking Company. I finally tried their famous pancakes this weekend, and let me tell you.. they deserve every bit of the hype. Fluffy, lil crispy on outside, and served with their homemade maple butter sauce that’s honestly addictive.. it’s what makes this dish so uniquely delicious.\n\nWe also ordered the raspberry yogurt cupcake (light, tangy, and perfectly balanced) and their fried chicken, which was crisped to perfection with a beautiful honey dressing and some hot sauce that tied everything together. Every bite felt like comfort food done right. Simple ingredients, but executed flawlessly.\n\nThe best part? Despite it being a weekend morning, I didn’t have to wait in the infamous line (which can get really long). I booked ahead on Resy, and it made the experience seamless, definitely recommend doing that if you’re planning a visit.\n\nBottom line: come hungry, book ahead, and don’t skip the pancakes. They might just be the best in NYC"

            "text": "My visit to Clinton St. Baking Company was an experience that certainly lived up to its reputation, though with a few caveats. Getting a reservation, especially on a weekend, felt like a quest, so I opted for a weekday evening. The atmosphere was bustling and lively, definitely on the noisier side, which meant it wasn't the spot for a quiet, lingering conversation, but it had a charming, classic diner vibe.\n\nThe service was consistently excellent; the staff were attentive and efficient despite the crowd. Now, for the food – the pancakes are truly exceptional. Fluffy and delicious, particularly the blueberry ones with their warm maple butter, they are an absolute must-try. Their signature chicken and waffles also lived up to the hype; the chicken was huge, crispy, and paired perfectly with a fantastic hot sauce, offering great value. I was also pleasantly surprised by the salmon burger, which was incredibly tasty, and the double bacon was like delicious beef jerky.\n\nWhile most dishes were fantastic, I found the truffle Brussels sprouts a tad salty, and the crispy potato pancakes weren't as crispy as I'd hoped. The seasonal drinks, like the hot buttered rum, were unique and strong. Despite the potential for long waits and the bustling environment, the quality of the food, especially the baked goods and signature dishes, makes Clinton St. Baking Company a highly recommended spot for an indulgent breakfast or brunch. Just remember to book ahead!"

My friends and I shared an amazing spread: the Brioche French Toast with caramelized bananas, Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter, Crispy Potato Pancakes, and a Fried Chicken Sandwich. Every dish was flavorful, comforting, and very filling, definitely come with an appetite. The staff were kind, patient, and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed, even with a last-minute to-go order. The space at night feels cozy and relaxed, with warm lighting and a lively atmosphere that makes it great for groups or a casual night out."

The chocolate-chip stack is rich and melty without being too sweet. Portions are big (a stack of three is easy to share). Cozy NYC brunch vibe with friendly service and a chalkboard of specials. Expect a wait—go early on a weekday if you can. If you love brunch, this spot is a must."
