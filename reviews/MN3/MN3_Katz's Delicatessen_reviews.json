            "text": "The place was filled with people trying to line up for sandwiches. They had no real system in place and the place was not that clean, maybe it because it was busy . I went to the restroom and when I came back my food was gone from the table and someone else was at my table….  weird.\nThe food was salt so if you have high blood pressure or have special dietary restrictions you may want to think . This is not the experience you want to rethink.\nIt was like getting food at a war zone for me the taste was not exceptional it was not worth what I went through to get to the door . Standing in line outside for over 20 minutes.\nIn summary I have had better sandwiches and service at other places in NYC I would not recommend unless you want the experience and look at pics of famous people.\nThey do give you a big sandwich but you have to pay\nIt was 28 dollars and we had corn beef on a hero, beans which were loaded with sugar ."

            "text": "Read this if you're easily overstimulated & overwhelmed:\n\nEveryone gets a ticket when they walk in (even if you don't order anything) - don't lose this ticket!! You give the ticket to the person at each counter so they can tally up your order total. Before leaving, you stop at the register to pay.\n\nThere are 4 counters -\n1 (counter closest to the street) - knish, hot dog, soups - this counter isn't really labeled (none of them really are lol). But you'll see the menu for knish, hot dog, soups, etc. listed above the area and there should be someone standing by the grill\n2 - meats -- there are numerous meat cutters, you can just pick whichever number you fancy\n3 - drinks - underneath the big sign for Dr browns root beer\n(Right around this area is a station to get forks/ knives/spoons)\n4 (counter furthest back) - latkes, blintzes, desserts, Togo station - you'll see workers with iPad registers. You can order here, have them wrap up your leftovers, or pickup a Togo order.\n\nYou have to order each item at its respective station. This requires a bit of planning. I recommend sandwich station\n(2) first. Soup, knish, hot dog (1) or drinks (3) have minimal lines and you get your item almost immediately, so l recommend getting these items after your sandwich.\n\nLatkes and blintzes take a bit to make so if you have two people, maybe have one order the blintz/latke while the other orders the sandwich. The sandwich doesn't take long to make, it's just the lines are a bit longer than other stations.\n\nFood was absolutely delicious! Portions are huge!! I split a pastrami sandwich, matza ball soup, knish, latkes (comes with 3 huge latkes + sour cream & apple sauce) and blintzes (comes with 3 cheese blintzes + sour cream, jelly & apple sauce). It was way too much for for the two of us lol. I love latkes & blintzes and wanted to try them here but I don't think I'll order again. They weren't bad, it's just that it was way too much food with everything else. If you're gonna get one thing, definitely get a pastrami sandwich (with extra sauerkraut). Their mustard is out of this world!! The knish is good but I'm pretty sure it's the same as every other knish l've had in NY lol"

Drinks are in a separate line from the food. So are the sides.\n\nIf you have someone with you, have them grab a seat while you order. Tip if you can!

Być może miejsce to padło ofiarą swojej popularności, przez co spadła jakość. Sama wielkość porcji bardzo duża - spokojnie wystarczy na dwie osoby."

Dafür reicht es aber locker für zwei. Pommes und Trinken gibt es an einer anderen Ausgabe, also wieder anstellen und hoffen, dass dein Sandwich noch heiß ist. Cash kann nur am Ausgang bezahlt werden, für KK-Zahlungen gibt es wieder einen extra Schalter. Das Sandwich ist ohne Frage sehr gut, das Fleisch total zart. Innen ist es sehr voll und laut. Fazit für mich: Wir waren mal da, Essen war lecker, aber ganz schön teuer. Ambiente hatte was vom Bahnhof. Muss jetzt für uns nicht noch mal sein,"

Just want a sandwich sir. Take these red tickets and see the server bottom right, ok.\n\nServed by a lovely waitress, now we ordered the famous pastrami and a tuna salad as the wife don’t eat beef. Wow what a massive stack of beef, this sandwich is huge, tucked in and first impressions are salt and nothing else, I’m thinking heart attack on a plate and I’m not wrong. Managed to eat 80% of this monster salt incarnation of a beef sandwich. This made me sick the next day the body could just not digest the salt and red meat and I’m a full on carnivore, medium rare sort of guy.\n\nLooking around this place it’s full of self glorification with pictures of people I’d never known or seen, we did see one picture of George Forman from probably 30 years ago . The place looks like it needs some serious renovation it’s stuck in 1954 and looks like it’s not been cleaned since. Filthy signs that never get cleaned, this dump is living on its reputation from a bygone era.\n\nIn conclusion, absolutely overrated and over priced. Do yourself a favour and don’t waste your money."

You can tell them what you want to eat except for the side and drinks, they'll make and give the menu to you right away\nHere's a tip I found at the expense of... 🥺\nFind someone with a lot of tips in the tip box! As soon as I entered, I ordered the half of pastrami sandwich and matzo soup from the man I saw and he gave me the wrong menu. He gave me only a whole sandwich. When I told him this wasn't the menu I ordered, he just shrugged. I wanted to try the soup!! 😭\n2. Anyway, if you receive the food, you also get a ticket. You can go to the left counter and order the side and drinks. You should give the ticket to the man there. I had cream soda instead of cola and It' was quite delicious. Try it!\n3. Most people left the dishes on the table after finishing it, I gave it to the cleaning staff directly.\n4. In case of the card payment, you can pay at the counter on the left of the side and drink corner. Show your ticket to the casher and receive the receipt. And finally show the receipt the person who is in front of the door when you left. If you pay with the cash,  you can go right to the door and show your ticket out and pay\nI visited there in the saturday morning, like 9am, and there are many vacant seat.

That’s where you order and get a sandwich. Ask for pickle if you want one.\n3. Enjoy eating.\n4. If paying by cash, give the ticket (recepit) to the cashier at the entrance and make payment. If paying by card, give the ticket to the cashier near where delivery orders are stacked inside and make payment.\n\nPastrami was great but to have a whole sandwich by oneself, it ends up being somewhat greasy and salty although first 3-4 bites don’t give you such impression. Pastrami is really poured into this sandwich. And it was also quite inconvenient to have it as the sandwich does not hold up together very well. I liked it as one-off experience but don’t think I will come again.\n\n샌드위치 시키는거라면\n1. 입구에서 티켓을 받습니다. 이게 영수증 같은 역할을 할꺼에요.\n2. Cutter라고 써있는곳이 몇군데 있는데 그 중에 가서 하나에 줄을 선다음 샌드위치를 주문합니다. 피클을 원하면 피클도 주문합니다.\n3. 맛있게 먹습니다.\n4. 현금지불이라면 입구쪽의 계산대에 아까 그 티켓을 내고 돈을 내면되고, 카드지불이라면 배달음식이 쌓여준비 되어있는 건물 안쪽의 카운터 바로 옆에 가서 그 티켓을 내고 지불을 하면 됩니다.\n\n고기(pastrami)가 맛나기는 하는데 딱 샌드위치 반개정도가 안물리고 맛있게 먹을수 있는 한계인듯합니다. 배가 부르냐 아니냐의 문제 이전에 고기 양이 너무 푸짐하다보니 계속 먹다보면 기름끼와 소금끼에 질릴수밖에 없는 구성인거 같아요. 줄 너무 안서고 먹을수 있는 상황이라면 한번 경험 삼아 먹어봐도 괜찮다는 느낌인데, 정말 놓치면 후회한다 그런건 아닌거 같습니다."
