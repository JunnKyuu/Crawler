We had the chicken soup, fried chicken, shrimp in fish sauce, papaya salad, crab fried rice, and minced pork with basil. Everything was delicious, but my favorites were the papaya salad and crab fried rice.\n\nWe didn’t get to try the cocktails this time, but I’m definitely coming back for that on my next visit.\n\nThe location is also perfect, great spot for a full meal before bar hopping in the area.\n\nCan’t wait to come back!"

They feature a fun drink menu, named after the “Twelve Sisters” folktale, along with both classics like pad Thai and curries and specialities like their roast duck or sautéed vermicelli. I was personally most impressed by how tender and juicy their duck came out, paired with a savory soup! I liked the flakiness of the roti as well. The chicken skewers were fine but not overtly impressive. Also liked the flavors of the noodles, but personally prefer larger chunks of crab meat. Everything was beautifully presented! Great for a casual date or if you’re just seeking some Thai eats in the city (located in East Village). Reservation not required."

Nestled on a quiet street in the East Village, MayRee offers a homey and authentic Southern Thai cuisine.\n\nIn my opinion, most Thai restaurants in NYC are either \"good\" or \"very good,\" and MayRee easily falls into the \"very good\" category, with its delicious food, drinks, and warm service.\n\n＊Park Mor $15 **\nI always order park mor, a sweet peanut steamed dumpling, whenever I spot it on the menu, as it's a rare find. It quickly became our favorite dish of the night. The chewy dumpling skin encased a peanut filling that was crunchy, sweet and savory. The dumplings were also beautifully presented in shades of blue and white.\n\n＊Somtum $16\nMy all-time favorite thai appetizer. Crunchy, tangy and refreshing. Be warned—they really mean it when they say \"medium spicy\".\n\n＊Kaeng Phed Ped $31**\nWe've had crispy duck curry at several Thai spots, and this one served the most tender duck by far. The curry was addictive, with pineapple, lychee, and cherry tomatoes simmered in the rich and spicy curry sauce. We couldn’t stop digging into the dish—it was that delicious.\n\n＊Pad Mee Kati $27\nIt was a southern thai style sautéed vermicelli noodles, topped with lump crab meat and omelette. Not only was it picture-perfect, but it was also absolutely delicious. I especially enjoyed the thin, chewy noodles.\n\n＊Fried Ice Cream $12\nUndoubtedly a showstopper. I was stunned to see the ice cream not melting in the fried ice cream! It was coated in breadcrumbs, garnished with coconut flakes and chocolate drizzle. Then the server set it aflame, turning it into a mini fire show. The crust did have a taste of alcohol for the flaming purpose, and was a tad too thick for my liking.\n\n＊Lychee Thai Tea $6\nVery refreshing and served with real lychee. Less heavy than an actual thai iced tea because it didn’t have milk in it.\n\n＊Prysob (Mekhong rum, mango, lime, honey) $17\nOur server strong recommended this cocktail to us. It was served with a slice of dried mango. Sweet and tropical. I personally disliked alcohol, but this drink was so smooth and sweet that I would have thought it was just a juice!!"

            "text": "Decided to check out Mayree after the Lunar New Year parade in Chinatown and boy were we pleased.  From the service, to the food, to the drinks, everything was spectacular.  Extremely creative and tasty dishes, same goes for the drinks.  Presentation was amazing and while I just started learning Thai cuisine, I felt comfortable asking questions and ordering from the menu. We also got to try Thai moonshine and went for a second round.  Prices are very reasonable.  Will be coming back for sure!"

The taste is on the sour (authentic) side. I personally don't like it very much but my friends liked it a lot.\nCrab fried rice has a very good texture, but not very savory enough.\nMongo sticky rice was very good 👍"

We got the Tom yum soup, pineapple duck curry (super tasty with fruity and coconutty hints), basil pork with rice (so flavorful and well cooked). We enjoyed all dishes. For its serving size, the price is on the higher end but the flavor makes up for it:))"

The Hed Tod mushrooms and Park Mor butterfly pea dumplings were standouts. Be sure to try the Pad Mee Kati with crab and the crispy Gai Tod Had Yai chicken!"

It’s crowded when we visited\non a weekend lunch time.\n\nThey serve mainly Southern cuisine in Thailand with various options. My personal favorite was their green curry which was rich and creamy with flavorful ingredients.\n\nFried chicken was cooked properly, crispy and juicy inside. My roommate loved their two dipping sauces which were appetizing."

The crab fried rice and spring rolls were also delicious. Shame the bar seating wasn't the most comfortable, but my experience overall was a good one. Thanks for the food!"

We started with crispy Hed Tod mushrooms with sweet chili sauce and the Somtum papaya salad, both bursting with fresh flavors. For mains, the Pad Thai Hor Khai, wrapped in a delicate omelet, and the rich Kaeng Phed Ped duck curry were exceptional.\n\nThe cocktails were a highlight, especially the Morrakot, with sake, vodka-infused lemongrass, and coconut milk, and the indulgent Thai Tea Tikki Coco, topped with coconut flakes and edible gold leaf.\n\nCelebrating Pride Month, the ‘Proud to be Pride’ cocktail—a blend of gin, elderflower, and prosecco is def a must!\n\nWith top-notch ambiance, service, and unforgettable dishes, MayRee is a must-visit!"
