We were paying for the second bill that the waiter presented us when the waiter AGAIN accosted us saying we paid for the wrong bill even though it’s his responsibility to give us the correct bill. Yelling at customers for your own mistake TWICE is unacceptable. We then gave him a card to put the rest of the balance on and asked him to admit to his mistake because he yelled at us for not paying our bill, which he proceeded to not do and instead continue to yell at. We asked for a manager and were needed with a chuckle from another employee who then went to the server to laugh at us. This was highly inappropriate and we would recommend anyone who is served by a male server in his late thirties to early fourties’ wearing a scarf around his hair, to immediately ask for another server so you are not treated in the same disrespectful manner that we were. Apparently, here we as customers, we are supposed to keep track of how much our drinks cost and keep a running tab so we do not get verbally assaulted."

We tried some apps which were also good so there is nothing to complain about when it comes to the food, drinks, and service.\n\nThe atmosphere was the issue for me. This place packs in everyone so close together you can't even have a conversation with the person you came with without yelling. All the tables are along a wall going all the way back\nI had the unfortunate privilege of sitting in a seat that was constantly kicked because there were so many people at the bar area, there wasn't enough space for anyone to walk through without tripping over the leg of my chair. They should really limit the amount of people they let in because there was no clear path for anyone to walk through and the restroom and kitchen were both in the back so two hours of kicked chair was quite unpleasant.\n\nIf you dont mind it being really loud and you sit against the wall instead of in the aisle like I did you may have a better experience."

This is even for the bar that is over crowded and we had to wait a long time just to be taken note of.. another way restaurants have started to fleece off customers but pay a living wage to folks working there. Not sure if this goes to the servers as they propose a tip% in the check as well. I see in the reviews that the 20% was added due to covid, so the owner just conveniently forgot to remove it post covid. As for the drinks,  the lychee martini was great and was made about right and a good deal for happy hours. Food was ok, Loud environment, and service was mediocre, never to justify the added gratuity."

The vibe is consistently cool, with dim lighting, vibrant photos, and good music that set the perfect mood whether you’re there for a dinner date or after-work drinks with friends. I’ve even caught a live salsa band here, which was incredible, and celebrated a New Year’s Eve that was unforgettable! The bartenders have always been chill and welcoming, especially Xavier. On my most recent visit, I enjoyed some light bites like the fried chicken dumplings and sake shrimp skewers, both were delicious! And, of course, my partner’s favorite, the Lychee Martinis, never disappoint. Just a heads up, on weekends, it can get full, so plan to arrive a little early for the best experience. Highly recommend Verlaine as part of a fun night out in the area!"

Teşekkür ederim. Gece için Hanoi lychee martini tercih ettim . Ananas suyu ve lychee meyvesinin birlikteliğini beğendim . Vodka bazlı bir kokteyl ,ben daha tatlı olacağını düşünmüştüm ama  şeker oranı yeterliydi. Kokteylin içinde gerçekten lychee meyvesi olması hoşuma gitti . Ananas zaten severim. Eğer tropikal ve fresh bir lezzet arıyorsanız tercih edebilirsiniz. Kokteylin fiyatı 12 dolar . Bence New York fiyatlarına höre kokteyller uygun ve lezzetli. Mekanın dekorasyonunu ve çalışanların nezaketini sevdim.Ben beğendim tavsiye ederim."
