The Arabic music playing in the background just sets the vibeee.. And the pita… they bake it super hot so it comes out fresh, warm, and ridiculously good.

The zaatar (thyme/sesame)& laham biajeen (meat) and Muhamara didn't taste great. Muhamara especially should have a slight crunch to it since it has walnuts in it. This was so puréed that it was almost like eating red pepper paste on bread, which isn't very desirable as it was mushy. The manoush gibneh (cheese) was the best one. My friend also ordered the hummus fatteh which I tried. It was very light and soupy rather than a thicker dip as it should be. Flavor was also light as a result.\n\nTo be honest, growing up in a Lebanese household and visiting Lebanon & Beirut in the past, these flavors are not representative of Lebanese fare. This feels more Jordanian or mixed and isn't as pleasing with the flavors. Definitely consider another place for authentic Lebanese flavors. This ain't it."

Ahh, the toppings.  The zaatar was such a perfect blend and you get your choice of cheeses, we chose akkawi, which had a briny wonderful flavor that went so well with the sesame seeds and thyme.\n\nFor dessert, we got ashta, which is a clotted cream they make in house with orange blossom water and rosewater with honey and a maamoul/cahk cookie with a walnut filling and powdered sugar on top, which was my dad’s favorite type of cookie and I almost cried when I took a bite into it, bc I was wishing I could bring him some to try.  The ashta was my son’s favorite and had such a delicious consistency.\n\nWe can’t wait to go back and try so many of their other savory and sweet treats. Oh, I forgot to mention, there was plenty of seating, the restaurant was very clean, and even though they had a steady stream of customers, they were on top of it, and everyone was super friendly."

            "text": "Manousheh Restaurant truly excels in delivering an authentic taste of the Middle East, and their za'atar manousheh is nothing short of exceptional. From the moment you step inside, you're greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere that reflects the rich culinary traditions of the region.\n\nThe za'atar manousheh itself is a delightful experience. The dough is perfectly crafted, with a light and airy texture that complements the aromatic za'atar blend beautifully. The combination of thyme, sesame seeds, and sumac creates a burst of flavor that is both earthy and refreshing. Each bite is a harmonious balance of spices that transports you straight to the heart of Levantine cuisine.\n\nWhat sets this restaurant apart is not just the quality of their food but also the attention to detail in preparation. The za'atar is generously spread across the manousheh, ensuring that every morsel is packed with flavor. Whether enjoyed on its own or paired with a side of labneh or fresh vegetables, it’s a dish that satisfies cravings and leaves you wanting more.\n\nThe service is also commendable, with friendly staff eager to share their knowledge of the menu and recommend pairings. The restaurant's commitment to using fresh ingredients is evident, making each dish a wholesome choice."
