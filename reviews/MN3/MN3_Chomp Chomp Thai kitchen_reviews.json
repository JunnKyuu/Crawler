It was $12 for the drunken noodles with shrimp on their menu online for the lunch special and $13 on ubereats. We get there and they charged me $16.78. I’ll assume the 78 cents is tax and credit card fee but $16 for a lunch special when it still says $12 on the website? I asked the worker about it while I was paying but she said that they raised the prices a month ago. That’s fine but why hasn’t it been updated anywhere and why would it have been cheaper to order pick up via ubereats?\n\nThe food was good but this is ultimately a shady spot and I wouldnt trust them or their prices moving forward"

Reasonable prices for the lunch special which comes with either soup or spring roll. One note is the Tom Yum soup is more of the traditional type, with a clear & more spicy sour flavor as opposed to the type with coconut milk that you might find in most American Thai spots. Not a criticism by any means, but something to note! Super warm & friendly service, I will be back :)"

            "text": "This place made me mad. Mad at my stomach for not being big enough. A friend of mine brought me here because they claimed that this place had amazing food. At first, I was skeptical but I was quickly proven wrong. It's a small but cozy restaurant. The prices are really affordable and really worth it for how good it tastes.\n\nI ordered the Khao Soi and the Moo Ping Salad. What came out was a big gorgeous bowl of Thai curry noodles and a plate of grilled pork with a fresh salad + dipping sauce. It smelled delightful and looked stunning.\n\nThe Moo Ping was a big pile of grilled pork that paired remarkably with the sauce. It was a bit smoky and sweet. The salad was fresh and clean tasting. Overall, a wonderful start to the meal. If it was a bit more seared/ charred, I think I would like it even more but it's a personal preference. It's already great.\n\nThe Khao Soi had many elements that worked together to create a beautiful symphony of flavors.\nFirst off, there was the bow of crispy egg noodles. Despite being fried, it wasn't greasy and was very light. It could be eaten as it is or dipped within the curry. Regardless of the way I ate it, it was great.\nThen came the pickled mustard. I'm not a big fan of pickled mustard but it acted as a wonderful touch of acidity for the dish. It helped cleanse the palate and helped the curry shine.\nI absolutely loved the choice of raw red onion on the side. Red onion has a sharper and more pungent onion taste than yellow and white onions. The strength of the red onion helped accentuate the fragrance of the dish while perfuming the taste of the curry. It also added some freshness to the rich curry.\nThe boiled eggs were pretty normal, nothing to complain about. Clean extra protein and very tasty when submerged in the curry for a bit.\nThe egg noodles were good. It was springy and soft flat noodle and it absorbed a lot of the curry. However, I would have liked it a bit more if it had a little bit more chew to it.\n\nThere were two stars in this dish. The savory and fragrant Thai curry + the phenomenal chicken thighs.\nThe curry was a tad bit spicy (I have low spice tolerance, sorry) but was absolutely delightful. The spice added to the flavor and enticed you to eat more and more. Just when you think it might be too spicy, the coconut milk within the curry soothes the heat and mellows out the spiciness. The coconut added a bit of sweetness and creaminess and enhanced the addictiveness of the dish. It had a velvety and luscious mouth feel. Chomp Chomp also did not skimp out on the spices they added to the soup. I tasted several different spices but the aromatic that stuck out to me was the black cardamom. The salt levels were also perfect. It was savory and filling but it also tasted clean. It's not like those restaurants where you have to sleep after you finished eating. Here, you're full and have energy.\n\nThe chicken thighs was pretty much perfect. It was cooked in the coconut curry until it was tender. The chicken thighs fell apart when I picked it up with chopsticks. Have you heard of the saying fall off the bone? This is a step up from that. These were boneless chicken thighs and they were so tender, they fell off the meat. This made the chicken aromatic and infused it with so much flavor. It was sweet but also had all spices from the curry permeating through it. The chicken was at the bottom of the bowl so it's not shown in the picture but there was so much meat. I went here a week ago and I still dream of this chicken. It was so good that I had to order delivery the day after coming here. It's astounding how tasty it was.\n\nTLDR: Close to perfect place. COME HERE. You will not regret it. Huge portion and affordable prices and really delicious food. Probably the best use of $25 that I made in 2025"

We had the corn salad, curry puffs, and the Khao soi with sticky rice. All of which were a 10/10, and for a great price. Quick service and friendly staff. Highly recommend"
