I got the sourdough pancakes and they were some of the best pancakes I’ve ever had. He got a burger and it was amazing and so fresh! We also got lattes and the taste was so rich, they also decorated the top with hearts. Our bartender was amazing and was very attentive and gave us quick service, even though we were to-go orders he still attended to us as if we were eating at the restaurant. The artwork in the alley as you walk up to the restaraunt is amazing as well! We definitely plan to sit down and eat when we have more time!"

The space was so quirky yet elegant, the food was out of this freaking world (get the panzenella!!!), and the cherry on the top was the Michelin-level service. Truly, our waiter constantly was looking to help us elevate the night and create an incredible experience—no request was too small. I could not recommend enough how much you will love hosting an event here, or even just coming here for a normal meal!!"

This place has servers that actually care. With each course that came out, they made sure we got food that wasn't going to torture our insides. The amazing news doesn't stop there though. While you might not like this place if you're with Peta (or at least the decor) you'll find that everything inside is very homey. You'll forget you're in a restaurant. The adventure begins the moment you turn down the alley and walk among the various works of art that surround you. Come with an empty stomach and a sense of wonder."

            "text": "**We found many allergy friendly places in New York. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.**\n\nVisited Freeman's on our anniversary with my girlfriend during our recent trip to New York (May 2025). As a severe allergy sufferer (I carry two epi-pens), we always make it very clear to restaurants that I suffer from multiple allergies and list them out beforehand. We notified the restaurant that it was our anniversary and that I am allergic to Nuts, Sesame Seeds, Shellfish and Beans.\n\nWhen we arrived, the first thing I mentioned to the waitress serving us was my allergies. I am always very explicit that they are very severe. The waitress noted down each of the allergies and reassured me that she would notify the kitchen. I made my point about 3 times, as I would with anyone serving me, to ensure they understood the importance.\n\nI ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad to start and a Steak as my main.\n\nThe Chicken Caesar Salad arrived and before I tucked in, I gave it a quick glance to ensure there was nothing in there I could not eat. I always do this, just to be on the safe side. Although the restaurant is extremely dimly lit, I noticed that there were Sesame Seeds in the salad. First of all this was one of the allergens which I very clearly mentioned to the waitress would cause me to go into a reaction. Secondly, this was not even an ingredient listed in the Caesar Salad on the menu. I was shocked that this had happened and my girlfriend was so stressed she could barely eat. I called over the waitress and sternly explained the situation. The waitress went into defence mode and instantly shifted the blame onto the kitchen, mentioning it was nothing to do with her and that it was the chefs fault. She almost seemed so worried that I was going to sue her that she threw the kitchen under the bus to save herself. She mentioned that she had never seen anything like this before and took my plate away, mentioning that the 'Chef himself' would make me a new one. She also offered me the starter on the house.\n\nI made it abundantly clear and again was very stern that I did not want to leave the restaurant in an ambulance, nor did I want to spend my anniversary evening in an American hospital.\n\nMy girlfriend wanted to leave at that point, I should have listened. Instead, I trusted the waitress to bring a new Caesar salad which the 'Chef himself' had made.\n\nAs the waitress gave me the fresh Caesar Salad, she mentioned that the kitchen had 'triple checked' for my allergens. I once again inspected the dish. There were sesame seeds AGAIN. I could not believe it. I was so shocked. I told my girlfriend we were leaving and we got up. But not before we called over the waitress and spoke to the manager (who did not seem like she cared very much). The waitress was visibily upset, as were we. This was the most dangerous and unprofessional dining experience I had ever gone through.\n\nHad I not checked the dish (twice) I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.\n\nThe waitress offered me the steak to take away but how on earth could I trust them after what I had just seen and experienced.\n\nThis was the first time I had ever stormed out of a restaurant.\n\nThe fact that the waitress reassured me both the first and then the second times made us feel sick to the pits of our stomachs. In the end this is a matter of safety. If you can not cater to allergies, do not masquerade as if you can. If you have an allergy please DO NOT VISIT THIS RESTAURANT.\n\nThis was supposedly the pinnacle of our trip, our anniversary celebration. Instead, we left before our starters - angry, shocked and naseous at what we had just experienced. My girlfriend was in tears and I was also shaking as I had come very close to being hospitalised.\n\nIf you have an allergy please stay away from Freeman's, it is simply not safe."

The star for me went to the grilled octopus appetizer with Manila clams that was perfectly cooked and so flavorful. Next up was the pork chop which is a massive cut. Perhaps just a tad overdone for me but still very good and the collard greens that came with it were amazing. If there’s one course I could have skipped it was dessert. I had the sticky toffee pudding and while it was decent, it wasn’t amazing. Overall it was a really good meal though and I look forward to trying again for their brunch sometime."

Watermelon Feta Salad was so refreshing and the Sticky Toffee Pudding is not to be passed up. We even received two glasses of bubbly to commemorate our birthday celebration.\nMain courses and f Cavatelli and Steak Frites hit the mark and of course the side of Macaroni and cheese was winning combination.\nThe Cocktails Orpheus Ascending by and Mayan Harvest were outstanding!\nThe service from Brittany was superb. Dinner was well paced and her anticipatory attention was appreciated and noticed but unobtrusive and meld with the harmony of the rhythm of the courses served.

Among the selections, my personal favorites stand out: the acai chia pudding, a beautifully presented bowl filled with creamy, nutrient-packed goodness, and the breakfast potatoes, perfectly seasoned and crispy, adding just the right crunch to the meal.\n\nWhat truly elevated our visit was the exceptional service we received. The hostess, radiating warmth and friendliness, went above and beyond to make our experience memorable, even surprising us with celebratory drinks in honor of my birthday.

The vibe here is really nice - kinda homey and rustic. It was a pleasant experience. On the recommendations of other reviews, we had the Hot Artichoke Dip as a starter and it was great, so I would also suggest ordering that. The Norwegian Benedict was pretty decent but kind of basic. I would probably order something else next time. The Sourdough Pancakes were delicious, especially with the salted walnut butter. We were able to substitute the bourbon maple syrup for regular maple syrup. The service here was very good, the bathrooms were clean, and there was a guy who looks like Ben Affleck having brunch."

Once you make it to the end is where it's located.\n\nWe were wondering if we needed reservations. Went in around 1:30pm on a Sunday, not much of a wait as we sat at the bar til the table outside was ready. Service was quick and the waiter made many good suggestions and was awesome. The food and drinks were amazing, i would definitely come back for brunch in the future at this location."

I appreciated the prompt of service by the bartender and accuracy of making multiple drinks. The dishes were delicious, but the mussels appetizer was first place for me. Here are a few pictures to show why these food options are worth ordering."

It has the feel of a Colonial Tavern.  I went for Weekday Brunch so it wasn't crowded.  The Artichoke Spinach Dip is amazing.  I had The Crow as my cocktail.  It was 😋.  It's basis is Scotch and Irish Whiskey and it has Amontillado, Coconut, Ginger and Carrot.  It's creamy and rich and packs a punch.  The bartender, Beatriz, was a wonderful bartender.  The service is good.  The prices are a little high but on par for the area.  I will definitely be back."

Second floor has lounge with comfy couches. Big choice of red , white and sparkling wine. My Artichoke dip was good and portion was a good size . Pork chop was huge it’s good for two people. Desert was not that good and I would like for ice cream to be just a little bigger. I definitely have to comeback to try more dishes."

            "text": "This restaurant used to be a hidden, kind of a secret spot that wasn’t really known to many people. The words have gotten out since then, and it is now a super popular spot.\n\nWe didn’t have a reservation, so we decided to get there early. We didn’t have any issue getting a table with just a handful of people at that time. The inside was very cozy. Feeling of an old tavern or a log cabin, filled with animals and antlers on the walls.\n\nThey had brunch menu and lunch menu, and you can order from both menu during brunch. We ordered Five Cheese Macaroni and Skillet Eggs.  They both came in a small iron skillet. It was smaller than expected, but I always say quality over quantity. They were packed with flavor, comforting, and made really well.\n\nWe had a nice, relaxing, tasty brunch here. The service was polite and nice, we were well taken care of. The menu is a bit on pricey side, but the quality is super high. I have been wanting to try Freemans for quite a long time, I am glad we finally got to dine here! I would like to go back for more, and try some of their cocktails as well in a near future!"

            "text": "Great delicious tasting food, but this place gets 3.5 stars for me due to lack of service and overall experience being subpar at best.\n\nWe ordered the steak, pork shop, deviled horseback (bacon wrapped dish) and the banana foster for dessert. We shared all the dishes between 3 people and were quite full!\n\nThe acoustics and noise level in the restaurant made it a bit challenging to hear the person across from me, and the seating arrangement we had was right beside the bar so people kept bumping into my chair and made the experience a bit unpleasant.\n\nOverall, the meal was delightful (and I’d probably give the food 4.5 stars), but dining in is an experience and the lack of it brought this rating down to 3."

            "text": "Nice restaurant gives the look of being very old although we were kind of doped I fell as it is only 20 years old lol Anyways besides that the food we 3.5/5, service was great and atmosphere was generally very nice. The locality is unique which drew us there (the graffitis outside are amazing sight). We tried fish, steak, pork chops, and pasta with Brussels sprouts and salad so basically all varieties of food you can say. Felt prices are quite high for the quality and taste. Also nothing comes with side except steak which is also very odd considering the prices of entrees. Don’t think we will go back but decent for a one night dinner spot without reservations. We spent about $275 for four no drinks or desserts."

The food is spot on! 😘 I tried the full English breakfast, and it was flavorful and tasty. 😋 With a kiss of booze, everything felt so chill and satisfying. The restaurant is a bit pricy, but at the end of the day, it is New York standard. I will go back again when I have time. 😊"
