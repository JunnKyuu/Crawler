            "text": "I stopped into Claud alone before grabbing drinks nearby with a friend, and it turned out to be one of the most memorable dining experiences I’ve ever had! From the moment I walked in, the staff could not have made me feel more welcome. Their precision while cooking was memorizing to watch and the wine selection is endless.\n\nI was lucky enough to get a seat facing the open kitchen, and watching the team in action was absolute artistry. Chef Josh and his crew are magnetic, completely in sync, calm, and precise. The attention to detail is unreal, from the way each dish is plated to the rhythm behind the counter.\n\nMy server, Jan, along with Juliette and Marge, were incredible, warm, and genuinely interested in making Claud feel like home. The recommendations were spot-on, but honestly, you could close your eyes, point to anything on the menu, and it would blow your mind.\n\nAs someone about to begin culinary school, chatting with the chefs about their craft was inspiring. They were kind, generous with advice, and it translates into their dishes.\n\nWith their sister restaurant was featured in Infatuations’s Best New Restaurant of 2024, Claud feels right behind it, quietly carrying the same excellence and heart. It is one of those rare places that makes busy New York City feel like a cozy neighborhood.\n\nI cannot wait to go back again and again!"

            "text": "Have been here twice with my family. Some great variety and flavors to explore here. The simple yet diverse menu made it a perfect experience to try multiple dishes for decent prices for each dish.\n\nPersonally, the Chicken Liver Agnolotti is a highlight on the menu. Very rich, creamy liver inside the pasta with a delightful sauce. The portion/pasta size is a bit small, but packs so much flavor, so I definitely recommend it! If you want to share, you might want to get 2, or choose more options in addition.\n\nThe Dover Sole was incredible as well! A little pricey, however, the fish was excellently cooked and seasoned, and the citrusy sauce complimented it very well. I appreciated that I received a thick filet portion of fish. As it is only the fish on the menu without sides; the optional sides of Potatoes and Broccoli & Peppers are fairly basic preparation, but add simple starch and veggie pairing with the fish if desired.\n\nWhat I appreciated during my time there was the attention to detail by the staff. Very considerate and attentive and our waitress was very helpful in offering recommendations and answering questions I had.\n\nThe open kitchen makes it a very unique and intimate atmosphere. It is quite dim in there, so it does become harder to navigate the menu if eyesight is an issue. However, I will definitely be back and experience what more there is to offer here!"

            "text": "This French wine bar is a great option for a date night or dinner with friends. I went in a group of 4 and so we were able to try a variety of dishes, which I loved. The interior of the restaurant is intimate, romantic, and nice but casual (if that makes sense). Service is stellar.\n\nWe got two bottles of wine—both of which were amazing. I would definitely recommend trying out their wines! For appetizers, we ordered the foie gras, the shishito peppers with duck sausage, tomato mille-fueille, shrimp, and chicken liver agnolotti. Everything was delicious. While they are most known for their chicken liver agnolotti and shrimp (which I do agree at must-trys), the other appetizers we had did not fall short and everyone in our group had their own favorites. For mains, we got the pork chop, wagyu buvette, and chicken. The pork chop and chicken were the favorites of the night and I would say that you could skip the wagyu buvette (it just didn't stand out in my opinion and was a bit too salty). Wish we had room for dessert, but everything was phenomenal. (Maybe next time!)"

The hostess informed us that all the empty seats at the bar and tables had reservations so we could take a slice of cake to go. We obliged and asked for a slice of cake to go, she then said she needed to check with the kitchen if that’s okay after already offering that as an option. She came back to inform us that the cake was reserved for reservations only and we couldn’t take a cake slice home. She was so unkind and what kind of restaurant doesn’t allow patrons to sit and have some drinks and dessert! There were MANY available seats and I cannot imagine at 9pm when the restaurant closes at 10pm that they were about to get a rush of reservations.

The prices are on the higher end, but I’m not sure if it’s entirely worth it in my opinion. I knew I wasn’t the target audience but I definitely got stares from the staff - not sure if it’s bc I was the only POC or I didn’t dress the part, but it was not a good feeling. Especially the amount of money we spent. When I went to check my coat after I literally sat down, the hostess said it was only for people eating there. I literally CAME FROM MY TABLE. Bruh. Rude. It also took a few minutes for my friend and I to decide what to get & the server checked in maybe 5x. It was very overbearing. Items we ordered:\n\n- - - - - - chicken liver agnolotti: 5/5 so good\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - red shrimp with olive oil and garlic: 4/5 great, but not sure I’d get again\n- - - - - - spring mille-feuille with morels and oma: 6/5 so amazing\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - pork chop with smoked onion jus: 4/5 I’m not sure why I thought this would be a pork chop. But it was sliced.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - devil’s food cake: 4/5 It was good. But the most amazing thing? Strong statements as someone one their period.\n\nAlso ordered some other appetizers, but not sure the items. The food was good. But I have no plans to come back."

            "text": "To Joshua and Chase,\nUnfortunately we had a terrible experience at Claud on Sunday March 9th.  I never write reviews as I usually email the management or owners directly to let them know of the wonderful experiences we have anywhere we travel across the world.  We were so excited to celebrate my birthday as we came up from the Philadelphia area as our restaurant is closed on Sunday and Mondays.  We had the reservation weeks in advance and it was made by a very good friend in the industry as well.   We were very excited about the buzz of the restaurant and also we spend a lot of time dining in the East & West Village and Soho.\n\nUpon arrival we were seated at a bar table that looked right into the stairwell of the restaurant above.  Our backs were to the entire restaurant and right next to the host stand and entrance.  We asked if there were any other tables or seats anywhere as we had a reservation weeks in advance.  They were extremely annoyed and told us that only unless someone cancels as the last minute or no-shows.  It was 7:35 at the time.\n\nWe had a 7:15 reservation and we were running 7 minutes behind.  We called at 7:05 as we were coming from the Eastside on Central Park South and spoke with someone to let them know we were running about 5-7minutes behind.  They let us know that they MAY have a 9:15 booking behind us, but they would let us know when we walked in, as of 7:05 they did not have a 9:15 reservation.  It was 7:22 when we arrived for our 7:15 reservation.\n\nThe front of house staff was short, exasperated and completely arrogant.  We chose to leave as we were extremely uncomfortable and completely taken back.  They had a cavalier attitude that leant towards they did not care if we left because someone else will take the seats.  This is one of the biggest mistakes in our business.  Treat everyone as you would want to be treated.\n\nWe decided to go over to one of our favorites ~ Lure Fishbar on Mercer.  Lure was great and accommodating as always.  Hospitality was completely lost at Claud and it was shame because so many of our guests are looking forward to hearing our thoughts on Claud.  Unfortunately we will not be recommending Claud or Penny.  I hope Joshua and Chase are able to read this review and work on hospitality with their staff at Claud and Penny.  Thank you.\n\n“I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” ― Maya Angelou"

A wow from the start 🤩 As for the iconic mille-feuille, gorgeous layers of pastry, sleeper cheese, and juicy tomatoes. From savory to sweet and slightly acidic, the flavors balance super well. Kinda soggy but the taste makes up for it.\n\nMy fav is the agnolotti 💯 You def taste the chicken liver but the sage brown butter sauce has this slight sweetness that blends everything perfectly. This is the best enjoyed by wiping the plate with their house made sourdough!! For the bigger options, can’t believe I’m saying this but order the pork chop. I usually never order pork chop but this one is so tender and flavorful, I changed my mind 😋 Claud is very serious about their sauces. You can tell from the amazing broth of cockles and garlic scrapes that the halibut is served with. Fish felt a tad over cooked but the sauce stole my heart. I know I’ll be coming back to try the other dishes and most definitely the cake!\n\n💕 crab and corn fritters $21*\n💕 tomato mille-feuille $33\n💕 chicken liver agnolotti $24*\n💕 pork chop with smoked onion jus $39*\n💕 halibut with cockles $41\n\n드디어 나도 Claud 입성!! 모던 프렌치 요리를 선보이는 와인바인데 기대이상으로 맛있고 좋다 🫶 시그니쳐 디쉬는 세이보리 밀푀유. 버터리한 페스츄리 사이에 크리미한 치즈랑 과즙 가득한 토마토를 레이어드했다. 바삭함은 없지만 맛의 밸런스가 최고다. 짠맛, 약간의 단맛 그리고 신맛까지 매우 조화로움 🤤 옥수수 & 크랩이 들어간 프리터도 강추. 쫀쫀한 도우가 꿀맛.\n\n여긴 소스에 진심이다 🙆‍♀️ 파스타는 브라운 버터 세이지 소스, 폭찹은 감칠맛 뿜어내는 양파 주, 생선은 깔끔한 새조개 육수랑 나오는데 3가지 다 매력 넘침. 다양한 맛과 엄청 뚜렷하고 진득한 깊이를 맛볼수있다. 사이드로 주신 사워도우로 싹싹 긁어먹기~"

I will be dreaming about the agnolotti for the rest of my life. The pork chop was to die for, the caramelized onions were so good. The tomatille was one of the best bites ever, soooooooooo light and yummy. The cake really is like the cake from Matilda, but not sweet or too rich at all.

I tried the salt cod croquettes, tilefish with razor clams and spinach, red shrimp with olive oil and garlic, and the devil’s food cake for two.\n\nThe salt cod croquettes were creamy and enjoyable. The red shrimp was well-prepared, flavorful, and had a nice balance of olive oil and garlic but the portion is very small.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with the tilefish was disappointing. I found a hair in the dish, and the fish itself was bland and lacked seasoning. Although the waitress promptly replaced it and even brought out a lettuce salad while I waited, the replacement still failed to meet my expectations.\n\nThankfully, the meal ended with the devil’s food cake for two. It was rich, indulgent, and absolutely delicious—an absolute must if you visit. Overall, the service was attentive, but the quality of the tilefish left me disappointed. I’d recommend the croquettes and the dessert but approach the main courses with caution."

I totally understand the struggle of booking this restaurant because it was delicious. I personally liked the appetizers more than the main dish we had which was the duck breast special. Really wanted to try their croquete and razor clams but it wasn’t in their menu when I went but the Mushroom Mille-Feuille with Whitney Cheese took over my heart. It was so good that I melted. Plus, save some space for the dessert at the end because that devil’s food cake is really a devil that will make you want the cake all for yourself. Great people, great atmosphere and great food. The mushroom mille-feuille will see me soon."

The sub level space is very comfortable, with seats along the open kitchen and a patio in the back. We worked our way through the wine list by the glass, relishing the chance to try several different producers and styles than what you’d typically find at most places in the city. We enjoyed several of the dishes for our meal, highlighted by the razor clams, escargot croquettes, shrimp, chicken liver agnolotti, and the devils food cake to finish."

The vinegar on the thinly sliced squash scattered on the grilled squash adding yet another contrast in flavors.\n\nRed prawns was their rendition of the classic gambas al Ajillo - the fragrance, when it comes sizzling, you cannot get enough of that.\n\nThe tomato millie-feuille was not quite the explosion of flavors - flavors had a lighter touch, like how the pastry was light and fluffy.\n\nComing to the “mains”, the chicken was perfect - crisp skin locked in the natural juices. But the swordfish was probably the “disappointment” of the night - while it’s nicely grilled, I can’t quite grasp the flavors… too in your face without achieving much.\n\nLucky enough to share a few desserts with the newfound friends along the bar top and I would say, save yourself some space for that."

Also note that this review is based only on the 5 starter dishes that we ordered of which there were 2 standouts: the Coppa with the blue cheese and the foie gras terrine -- both delicious. Then came the misses: the red shrimp floating in olive oil, the mushroom mille-feuille, and the chicken liver agnolotti (the latter was a total meh and I know it's gotten raves from other reviewers). The final disappointment was the chocolate cake. I don't know if it was dry as a bone on purpose or perhaps it was  stale."

Shrimp with garlic tasted like the Platonic ideal of my most favorite Spanish dish. I have tried more than a hundred variations of it all over the US and Spain, and this one turned out to be the best version of them all. The most surprising twist was the root beer ice cream. I hate root beer and tried it only because my date ordered it.  The first bite transported me to the Atlantic City boardwalk of the 1950s. The ice cream, served in a cool metal coupe, tasted like someone else's childhood. Don't miss it."

The mushrooms and foie gras were the standouts and I would highly recommend ordering, because they are perfect accompaniments to the wine available by the glass. I’m no somm, but there are definitely some familiar names and/or regions available. We drank by the glass and they had solid selections available, both whites and red.
