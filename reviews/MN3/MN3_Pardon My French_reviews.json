It came sliced, which I don’t prefer. It also was overcooked (I ordered it medium rare but came medium well).\n\nIn terms of the service… food was very slow to come out. There were several severs running food, refilling waters, etc. which was lovely.\n\nWhile the steak was disappointing, I would come back to order the other items again.

The French cuisine offers a good variety of different signature French dishes. I recommend the escargot and octopus carpaccio as appetizers. For the entrée, I ordered branzino. It was good, but it had a light fish taste, which I personally don’t like (based on my experience, well-cooked fish usually doesn’t taste too fishy). Meanwhile, the mussels were made great. I’m not a big fan of them, but they are cooked very well at this place. To sum up, it’s recommended for an old-vibe New York dining experience."

The host/server we had (I wish I got their name because they *made* our experience) was a true ray of sunshine and such a sweetheart and our table of 8 girls had a thoroughly fantastic time. The only reason I withheld a star was 1) it’s cash only and you may not know that off the bat, which is a bit frustrating 2) it was a muggy day and there didn’t appear to be air conditioning at the premises- it was a bit muggy and humid. Otherwise, it was a lovely time- the food isn’t to die for but it was still delicious for the price especially!"

We’d both been at this restaurant a lot years ago when it was Casimir, and it still has the same cozy ambience and great bistro food. We started with the Chèvre Chavignolles salad; it came with perfectly toasted rounds of goat cheese and nicely dressed mixed greens. The wine list is good and uncomplicated – you can spend not too much and still have a very nice glass of wine.  You can also spend a lot. We kept things simple and had the Côte du Rhône and Pinot Noir with Coq au Vin and Cod en Papillotte, both delicious. The only disappointment was the Tarte Tatin, which didn’t live up to the rest of the meal: an individually baked serving on a cracker-like crust with a dollop of ice cream. That said, I’ll happily return: a fun bistro with friendly efficient staff, delicious food, and great atmosphere."

I had the Eggs Scandinavian, my partner got the Tunisian Eggs. My partner's only complaint was that it felt light, so if you want a fuller brunch I'd recommend getting a third dish to split if you're with someone.

Just like French fries aren’t really French, this dish isn’t exactly either. The first time this name was given was by the English! Although the French do have a similar dish called pain perdu, meaning lost bread. Pain perdu was made from stale bread that would’ve otherwise been tossed out.

The butter had a tint of garlic in it, which dramatically enhanced the combined taste of the bread.\n\nI first ate the bone marrow, and dare I say it's probably the best bone marrow I've ever had. It's incredibly succulent, and the additional seasoning augmented the natural taste of the marrow. It melted in my mouth, and anything left in the actual bone was quickly scooped up by the bread that came along with it.\n\nI also ate the daily special, which was a rack of lamb. Overall, it was a very solid piece of meat, not too rare, and not too dry. It came with vegetables (also very good and crunchy) and potato soufflé. The soufflé was very creamy and and an excellent addition to the meal.\n\nOverall, it was a very good meal. Service was excellent as they attended to out every need and was very prompt about it.\n\nExcellent food with excellent service; what more could you ask for?"

I don't mind cost cuts if the guest doesn't know/feel the difference,  but here, you feel it every step of the way. You dine in a HOT unairconditioned hallway with wobbly wooden tables long past due for retirement. Unfiltered tap water to drink. NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED; CASH ONLY. Prosecco mimosas made with mostly OJ. Greens as side but when asked for potatoes instead they said it would be a $10 upcharge, even though potatoes are less food cost than greens and you get about 1/2 cup total. Undercooked egg whites on croque madame, no Mornay sauce, and VERY poor quality eggs. Website advertises that the entire staff speaks french, but the spanish speaking backserver was confused and non-responsive when addressed in French. Spend $20 more overall at a different brunch place of your choice and get double the bang for your buck! Not reccomended!! Would NOT go back."

            "text": "Great food but abysmal service...\n\nTo start things off, I had a brunch reservation set for 1pm but our table wasn't ready until 40 minutes later. We were initially seated inside and then the hostess came and said our table was actually outside instead. When we sat down at the outdoor table we were disappointed to find holes in the table and leftover food and drinks from the previous customers that took even more time to get cleaned up.\n\n**this place is also cash only, which I've never heard of for a brunch spot. They didn't say that anywhere on their website so we had to spend even more time finding an atm....\n\nIt was so hot and humid outside and the outdoor area didn't have enough umbrellas, so it was a pretty rough experience until we got our mimosas which also took an egregiously long time. My friends purse got stuck in the table we were sitting at and the chain broke cause we had to yank it out. It would be nice if they get some better tables outside.\n\nI will say the quality of the food is better than most brunch places I've been to. I'd personally recommend the Nutella French toast"

The brussel sprouts were so amazing we decided to order another one, but the second plate was overcooked and soggy as opposed to the perfectly cooked first plate. Disappinting in that regards,  but i hope it doesn't happen often. Bottomless mimosas was also nice."

I went there with a big group of friends and they constantly brought us jars of mimosas. I have the EGGS BENEDICT and it tasted very good, they come with some potatoes and salad. The staff is very kind and attentive. Fully recommended!\n\nESPAÑOL:\nRestaurante genial para brunch con bebidas ilimitadas pero ten en cuenta que esta opción incluye un plato y mimosas ilimitadas por $41 SOLO EFECTIVO! Fui con un gran grupo de amigos y nos trajeron jarras de mimosas constantemente. Tomé los EGGS BENEDICT y estaban muy buenos, vienen con patatas y ensalada. El personal es amable y atento. Totalmente recomendado!"

            "text": "Notes: CASH-ONLY $$$\n\nFood + Price\nWe reserved ahead for a table of 9 for brunch for 1pm on Saturday. Brunch is a prix-fix of $39 for bottomless mimosas, and $26 w/o alcohol. The establishment has all of your brunch staples, eggs benny, pancakes, avocado toast, etc.\n\nI opted to not get breakfast so late into the afternoon and ordered the Moules-frites $24 (mussels and french fries). Sizable mussels, no grit, and perfect garlic flavor. Only wish I had some bread to dip into the pot to absorb all the soup. Fries were perfectly crispy and satisfying.\n\nA lot of friends ordered the eggs benny, they cleaned their plates. The burgers were cooked to perfection and huge (they come with fries even though it doesn't say on the menu)\n\nVibes + Wait Staff\nIts a beautiful place and has outdoor patio seating which would be great if it was warmer. Loved the bar upfront to chill and wait for you table before being seated. Unfortunately but understandably, b/c its so popular and busy expect a little longer wait times here and there and do not expect to be able to idle around to chit chat. The waiters need to prep for the next customers so after the bill is paid expect to skidaddle out. Apart from that, the staff were attentive, polite and super efficient.\n\nOnly one unisex bathroom available (no hooks inside to hang ur bag or jackets ladies)"

            "text": "Lovely, lively, and fun Birthday Brunch on the patio! We had a reservation for one PM and were sat immediately. Wonderful service. Ordered: Egg’s Benedict- was good- eggs perfectly poached. Steak Frites- crispy fries & steak was cooked as ordered, med-rare and tasty. Tunisian eggs was good- probably wouldn’t order again….but enjoyed something different. Waitress was lovely & attentive. Ordered Bottomless mimosas & Bloody Marys- not very boozy but we enjoyed them. This is not the place for a ‘cheap boozy brunch’ - the bottomless brunch limits you to the front of the menu items… so be aware before you go. Inside was very loud so we were happy to be on patio, which I had requested at time of reservation; it’s adorable and more quiet but still fun. Had Aperol Spritz after brunch and they were probably best ones I’ve ever had. Sorry, we ate our food before getting photos. We Would definitely go back. The staff rocks!"
