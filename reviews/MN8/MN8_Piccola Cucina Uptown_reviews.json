Ordered several appetizers and main courses to share with the table.  Then had great deserts. Erica the hostess is wonderful and always makes our visit a memorable dining experience.\nHighly recommended!  Visit often.  Reservations a must.\nBack again for lunch with friends.  We ordered pasta with sausage and salad with tuna. Both were very nice. Large portions."

            "text": "Piccola Cucina Uptown used to be one of my go-to spots, but it’s really gone downhill. The food quality has dropped a lot — the Tiramisu  was especially bad this time. Even worse, they refused to accept my gift card, claiming it had “expired” after a year — which is actually illegal under federal and New York State law. When I tried to explain this, the manager was rude and dismissive instead of trying to help. Really disappointing to see a place I used to love treat loyal customers this way."

En especial, Mario en la barra de abajo fue sumamente amable y servicial. La comida deliciosa, comenzamos con unos calamares a la plancha perfectamente cocidos y llenos de sabor, y un trío de carpaccios muy bien presentados. De plato fuerte, probamos el pasticho, muy sabroso, y los capitelli, que estaban realmente exquisitos. Un lugar cálido, con gran ambiente y atención de primera. Sin duda, ¡muy recomendado y con ganas de volver!"

            "text": "VERY DISAPPOINTED with my experience today. I had a restaurant gift card with remaining balance, but they REFUSED to accept it just because it was “over a year old.” I checked both federal and New York laws — there is NO rule that allows a gift card to expire after one year. This is NOT OK.\n\nThe manager showed me an email that someone else supposedly received and said it was my problem. I explained several times that no one ever told me about any expiration when I bought or used it before — I was even told it would NOT EXPIRE. She just kept saying “that’s not possible.”\n\nI ended up paying out of pocket. Later at home, I checked their website — and it says NOTHING about any expiration date. This is completely MISLEADING and feels like FRAUD. UNACCEPTABLE customer service and dishonest policy."

The truffle branzino is an absolute must try unforgettable flavor!Unfortunately, the cacio e pepe was disappointing beautiful presentation but too watery and lacking in cheesy flavor. The signature clam spaghetti was nice for seafood lovers.The biggest letdown was the service. My cocktail arrived 20 minutes late (and only after I asked again), and it tasted mostly like water and ice. The wine came out almost after we finished the appetizers, and the server didn’t pour it, just left it on ice bucket. She sent out all the appetizers at the same time, even though we were there to enjoy a relaxed, pleasant dinner(the  table was small, and unfortunately, it was impossible to find space for more than two appetizers.)\nDesserts were fantastic. I wish the server had treated us more like guests rather than just customers. We wouldn’t have felt like they wanted us to leave quickly, and we would have had a much nicer overall experience."

A perfect lunch experience for my lazy Sunday.  All kudos to Edwin and the kitchen!"

The restaurant's rustic vibe adds a warm and comforting ambience and let's not forget the staff! The folks at Piccola Cucina were so friendly and accommodating, especially since I came here for a work lunch consisting of over 10 people!\n\nOh, right, the FOOD!!! I don't know where to start but I included images to this review. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words. Right?\n\nI personally had the ossobuco ravioli, and I couldn't have enough!\n\nPro-tip: Check out the beautiful bar too! I definitely want to return and sit there for some wine and appetizers."

The staff also weren’t ready for our booking and seem frustrated that we had inconvenienced them. We did arrive early however we were waiting for over 10 minutes.

Was a no brainer given the perfect service we experienced on our previous visit. We got lucky with their upstair seating this time around, and were seated in a cozy 4-person seating.\n\nOrdered some crudities (delicious), fried fish which has a good amount of shellfish, and their amazing mushroom pasta which you can't go wrong with. When we said we are going to share the pasta - the super thoughtful staff ensured we got two portions served, something that we really appreciated! Order the Tiramisu for dessert and watch it being prepared in front of you for a unique experience!\n\nService was spectacular, including playing a kiddie happy birthday song for our little one which made him feel absolutely special. Can't ask for anything more! Will be one of our favorite places to go to, thanks to the excellent service, great experience, and excellent food!\n\nPrevious review: Had made reservations for dinner night with my family, and was greeted by a very friendly hostess who got us seated on our table. The ambiance and setup is very romantic and perfect for a date night of a family meal.\n\nWe got straight to ordering and got a bottle of Valpolicella ($129) which was absolutely delicious. Other things in our order included a tasty Caprese Salad ($21.95), and absolutely deliciously prepared Bucatini cacio e pepe ($26.95), Pappardelle ai funghi porcini ($25.95), and Cavatelli con ragù di agnello, carciofi ed erbette ($26.95).\n\nI am no Italian to certify amazing Italian food, but of all the Pasta's I've tasted in my life, this was the best pasta I've ever had. Flavor packed, perfectly cooked, and delicious food! Service was excellent, and food arrives within 7 minutes of ordering. Friendly staff too. Noise levels were slightly on the above average end. Will definitely recommend to friends and family and will definitely visit again!"

My 50 year old Italian father gave me a tip about one of their pastas which was amazing, for desserts we have the cannolis which were amazing and I’m not a big cannoli fan. The tiramisu was the best tiramisu I’ve ever had and my father confirmed. We told them about the birthday and they were so amazing about it and did a show and showed how they make the tiramisu in real time. My little brother had the ciaco e Pepe which was amazing and so authentic. As a 15 year old I’m not a pricing expert but my father says it’s not cheap but not expensive either. In conclusion it’s an amazing restaurant, and has an amazing garden view. An overall authentic, amazing experience, filled with great atmosphere, and most importantly amazing food."

It’s technically no longer on the menu, but they still make it for me every time I go, and it never disappoints. That kind of hospitality (and flavor!) is rare. Also, don’t sleep on the complimentary bread basket—the fresh bread and house-made sauces that come with it would already be reason enough to have me keep coming back."

It’s simply outstanding—chewy, perfectly cooked, and full of rich, comforting flavor. Honestly, it’s the kind of pasta that makes you stop mid-bite just to appreciate how good it is.\n\nWhenever I eat here, I leave feeling genuinely happy and grateful that a place like this exists in the city.

            "text": "This place is the real deal. The Italian hostess greets you warmly, setting the tone for an experience that feels authentically Italian.\n\nThe food is outstanding. I ordered the green tagliatelle with wild boar ragu and it was phenomenal. Honestly as good, if not better, than pasta I’ve had in Italy. The Caesar salad was also excellent, very fresh tasting and delicious. They start you off with bread and dips at the beginning of the meal, which is a thoughtful touch. I’m not a cannoli guy but I actually liked these. They’re great.\n\nService here is some of the best I’ve experienced in New York, incredibly friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. Really nice ambience inside too. If you’re looking for a true Italian restaurant that delivers on both food and atmosphere, this is the place. I’d absolutely come back."

Lasagna was also some of the best I’ve had in a long time.\n\nEverything was of higher quality. Service, food, and vibe all alike.\n\nWe were seated promptly without a reservation. Outside seating was also a plus.\nService was good. Server wasn’t present all the time because he was super busy, but he was very pleasant when he attended to our table and his runners did the job just fine.\n\nFood was delicious. We enjoyed every bite. It was well presented and flavorful.\n\nInterior looked beautiful and packed. We also loved seating outside and enjoying the nicer weather.\n\nThank you!\nWe’ll be back!!"

We celebrated our anniversary here and the staff went above and beyond congratulating us and giving us cannolis with a candle to celebrate.\n\nThe Cacio e Pepe and tiramisu gets served in the most beautiful authentic way that transported us back to Italy! Highly recommend! The food is to die for but the staff and wholesomeness of this place is what really sets them apart from others.\n\nIt is our absolute favourite and whenever we are in town we make sure to visit Piccola cucina!\n\nSincerely, your friends from Frosinone!"

It boasts flavors from the Mediterranean to Asia and could possibly be categorized as an Italian-Asian fusion.\n\nThe citrus marinated yellowtail with beets and mandarin carpaccio was incredible. The stuffed zucchini flowers were delicious.\n\nMy poke bowl with seared tuna and quinoa was amazing. Other dishes we tried were the poke bowl with salmon and Mediterranean salad.\n\nBeautiful restaurant and perfect setting for lunch, happy hour, or dinner."

It showed that this is definitely a popular place.\nWhen we sat, they were extremely apologetic and made sure that we were happy with the seating and even gave us a glass of Prosecco and a delicious cannoli at the end (on the house).\nThe food menu is very interesting, a lot of delicious choices. We shared a vitello tonnato that was amazing, very flavorful and spectacularly presented. We shared some pastas and they were al dente and very flavorful too. I would definitely come back to try many other dishes.\nThe wine list is well curated with reasonable prices.\nThe service was great too. We learned some Italian words and the proper way to eat a cannoli. It was a very enjoyable experience."

            "text": "Piccola Cucina Uptown is a lively and popular Italian spot in NYC. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was buzzing—dim lighting, shelves filled with wine and Italian goods, and a packed house that gave the place an energetic, almost festive vibe. Our waitress was just okay, but the busboys were attentive and helpful throughout the night.\n\nOur family shared several dishes. We started with the Piccola Cucina Salad—a vibrant mix of baby spinach, beets, oranges, avocado, toasted nuts, and dried fruit. It was super fresh and well-balanced, the perfect light and colorful way to begin the meal. But the pasta dishes were the real highlight. The Tagliatelle with ragù and truffle was rich, earthy, and deeply flavorful, with perfectly al dente pasta. The Rigatoni with lamb ragù was bold and indulgent—the richness of the lamb stood out, but the mint added a refreshing brightness that balanced it beautifully.\n\nWe also got to watch the cheese wheel pasta experience at a nearby table, where hot cacio e pepe was tossed in a giant wheel of Pecorino right in front of everyone. It was such a fun, theatrical moment and added to the overall experience.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the pistachio gelato and raspberry sorbet. The gelato was massive—super creamy, intensely pistachio-forward, and surprisingly salty in the best possible way. The sorbet was tart and refreshing, served with fresh berries, and made for a light, clean finish to a rich meal.\n\nOverall, the food was thoughtfully prepared and full of flavor, and the atmosphere made the night feel special. I’d definitely come back and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy, energetic spot for truly satisfying Italian food in the city."

The complimentary bread was a nice touch, served with three flavorful sauces/toppings on the side.\n\nMust-try dishes:\n- The octopus caprese with burrata, tomato confit, and basil was fantastic! The octopus was perfectly charred, paired beautifully with the creamy burrata, and drizzled with olive oil.\n\n- The trio of raw fish--salmon, tuna, and scallop--was incredibly fresh, seasoned simply with salt, pepper, and capers for a clean bite.\n\n- The green tagliatelle in wild boar ragù with truffles was good, though I would have loved a bit more truffle flavor.\n\n- The paccheri with scampi, langoustine, lobster, and shrimp was a highlight. The pasta was cooked al dente, and there was a generous amount of seafood.\n\nThe pastas are shareable and come in large portions. I'd highly recommend this spot and look forward to returning to try more of the pasta dishes!"
