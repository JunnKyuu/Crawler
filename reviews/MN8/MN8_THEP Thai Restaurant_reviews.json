            "text": "Thep Thai truly stands out, not just for its vibrant atmosphere, but for the exceptional quality and flavor depth found across its entire menu, especially in its vegetarian and chicken offerings.\n\nFor those seeking plant-based dishes, Thep is a revelation. The menu is clearly labeled with excellent vegan options, and the kitchen handles substitutions perfectly. The Vegan Pad See Ew with tofu is arguably the best I’ve ever had—rich, smoky, and perfectly textured. Don't skip the Avocado Massaman Curry (available vegetarian/vegan), which is wonderfully creamy, savory, and loaded with tender sweet potato. The commitment to flavorful, authentic vegan food here is top-tier.\n\nOn the non-vegetarian side, the chicken dishes are equally impressive. The Chicken Pad Thai is a classic for a reason, hitting that perfect balance of sweet and tangy tamarind flavor. However, the real showstopper is the Chicken Khao Soi (Northern Thai Egg Noodles)—the creamy coconut curry broth is incredibly deep and comforting, and the chicken (often bone-in, which adds to the authenticity) is cooked to perfection. It's an absolute must-try.\n\nWhether you're visiting for a comforting chicken classic or looking for sophisticated, flavorful vegan Thai, Thep delivers consistently high quality and is highly recommended.\n\nMinnie was awesome to help us with our order. A big thanks to her and entire staff for making our lunch good"

The Massaman curry was absolutely delicious, rich in flavor, tasty, and with a quantity generous enough for two people to share comfortably. The chive pancake was another highlight; it was so good that we ended up ordering it twice, though it was a bit softer than expected. The chive dumpling with Massaman curry was decent, but we felt the curry portion was slightly less for four dumplings. Beyond the food, the ambience was warm and welcoming, adding to the enjoyable dining experience."

Definitely recommend starting your night out with their seasonal cocktails. It’s hits the spot and tastes amazing. Food was delicious and felt authentic. Every dish was full of flavor which you can tell they care about what they’re serving. Staffs were super friendly and on point without being too much. THEP Thai is a great spot with good vibes, great food, and wonderful drinks. Thinking Thai tonight? You already know where to go."

We got the chive dumplings, pad kee Mao, and basil fried rice. The chive dumplings come with a curry sauce that’s very tasty. 10/10 would recommend"

            "text": "THEP Thai offers traditional Thai cuisine while also weaving in modern touches. The space itself feels serene and intentional, and the staff made the whole experience feel welcoming and easy. There’s a lot of thought put into the menu, not just in taste, but in how it brings pieces of Thai culture to the table.\n\nWe started with cocktails, my friend had the Mango Sticky Rice , made with rice-infused vodka, pandan liqueur, coconut rum, mango, lime, and milk. The drink captures the essence of khao niew mamuang, a classic Thai dessert of sticky rice with sweet mango and coconut milk. The pandan liqueur adds  a soft vanilla-like aroma, which is commonly found in Southeast Asian sweets. It was smooth and not overly sweet.\n\nI ordered the THEP Mule. The vodka was infused with Thai basil, an herb used in many central and northeastern Thai dishes. Unlike sweet basil, Thai basil has a slightly spicy, anise-like flavor that pairs beautifully with lime and ginger. The drink had a refreshing, earthy tone with just enough kick from the ginger ale. We also shared Coffee or Me?, which was made with Thai iced coffee, vanilla vodka, Kahlúa, Godiva, and cream. Thai iced coffee (oliang) is usually brewed with strong robusta beans and sweetened with condensed milk. Here, it was turned into a dessert cocktail, rich and layered, but not too sweet ,chocolatey and creamy in the best way.\n\nFor starters, we had the THEP Platter: a sampler of spring rolls, chive pancakes, crab rangoons, fried chicken dumplings, and fried shrimp dumplings. Each item had a crispy exterior and well-balanced filling. The crab rangoons, while originally Chinese-American, have become a common fusion item in Thai-American restaurants. The chive pancakes were savory and chewy, commonly found in Thai street markets under the name khanom gui chai.\n\nThe Papaya Salad (som tum) came next. This dish originates from Thailand’s northeastern region, Isan, and traditionally includes green papaya, long beans, tomato, peanuts, chili, lime, and pla ra (fermented fish sauce). It’s known for its sharp, pungent, and spicy flavor. The version here was more muted—fresh and crunchy, but the fish sauce and spice level were gentler, which made it more approachable, though slightly less authentic in intensity.\n\nThe Tom Yum Soup was done very well. This is a national dish of Thailand, and the shrimp version (tom yum goong) is one of the most recognized Thai soups globally. It had the signature lemongrass and galangal notes, balanced with lime and chili. The addition of coconut milk isn’t always traditional but adds a creamy texture that rounds out the heat and makes the soup feel more luxurious.\n\nFor mains, my friend had the Khao Pad Pu—crab fried rice served in a coconut shell. Fried rice (khao pad) is a common Thai comfort food, often cooked in a wok with fish sauce, garlic, egg, and vegetables. Here, it was elevated with sweet chunks of fresh crab and actual coconut meat scraped from the shell, which added a natural, light sweetness. The dish came with a spicy seafood sauce on the side, providing that traditional chili-lime-fish sauce punch.\n\nThe chicken red curry was also a standout. Gaeng phed is made from red chili paste, coconut milk, kaffir lime leaves, and often Thai eggplant or bamboo shoots. This version was creamy, aromatic, and had just the right amount of heat not overwhelming, but enough to highlight the richness of the curry paste. The chicken was tender and had absorbed the flavors well.\n\nI had the Ogg Pla Pan, a lesser-known but deeply flavorful dish. The branzino was seared well, but the shrimp paste curry it was served in was very bold rich with fermented fish sauce, dried chili, Thai herbs, and balanced with eggplant and cherry tomatoes. The sauce was intense and leaned salty, which could slightly mask the fish’s natural taste. It was still a very interesting dish for those who enjoy the deeper flavors typical of Southern Thai cuisine, where fermented seafood products are commonly used to create depth.\n\nOverall an amazing experience, will definitely be back."

The service was excellent and each staff member was attentive and polite. Our server Gift is so sweet!\n\nI’ve had their Thai ice tea as well as their rose Thai tea that was extremely refreshing on a hot day, perfectly sweet, and rosey. Our appetizers were the spring rolls and papaya salad, both vegetarian but still very flavorful and hearty.\nI had the red curry with chicken, which was phenomenal. It was a very tolerable spicy red curry that paired well with the chicken and vegetables in the dish.\n\nI really loved my experience at Thep Thai, and I am looking forward to coming here again!"
