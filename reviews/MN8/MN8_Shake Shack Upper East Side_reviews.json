            "text": "I placed a mobile pickup order around 4:51 PM and then went shopping next door. I arrived at the Upper East Side location around 6:11 PM, but my order was not ready. The female staff member at the pickup station was friendly and promptly notified the kitchen, but what happened afterward was concerning.\n\nA tall male staff member — who appeared to be in a managerial role — approached me and said they would only remake my order if I left a positive review. He also claimed that Shake Shack discards mobile orders if not picked up within a certain time window, which contradicts my past experience. When I declined to write a review on the spot, he took photos of my order confirmation and went to check the system. He later returned, said my order had never appeared, and manually entered it. I finally received my food around 6:30 PM.\n\nI usually receive a text notification when my order is ready, which did not happen this time. Technical issues can occur, but it is inappropriate for any staff member to pressure a customer for a positive review — especially when the order was missing in the first place. That’s why I’m here leaving this review."

If you're picking up order from this location, always remember to check the content, open the box to see the items match what you ordered.  I ordered Buy 1 + 1 burger. with fries but had some hiccup at ordering on UberEat. Manager was kind enough to help rectify the issue during my pick-up; the employees were busy chit-chatting with each other and handed me wrong items. Due to packaging, I couldn't tell and didn't suspect anything until I got home and realized instead of the +1 burger, I was handed small fries and another order of fries in a square burger box. When I went back to the store , the employees there was non-apologetic and told me if I wanted to cancel/return the order, he could do that. While I understand mistakes do happen during rush hours, error here was clearly caused by employee inattentiveness at work.  Instead of acknowledging mistake and apologize,  I the customer was made to feel I was the one at fault. Happy to take my business elsewhere and vote with my dollar.  If there's negative star/rating for customer service, that's what this location deserves."
