            "text": "I am shocked and dismayed at some of these glowing 5 star reviews. The theory of alternate universes can be proven by a trip to JG Melon alone. My experience could not be more diametrically opposed than these reviewers. Save for the staff, who were pretty good, this place is living on reputation. I'm guessing, tbh, since I haven't been there before last night. The only other thing it has going for it, is the fact that it's open late. Unfortunately, NYC isn't the city that never sleeps that it used to be. The story is this, we order two bacon cheeseburgers with fries, different temps on the burgers FYI. I kid you not, we got our food in under 3 minutes. I've never received food that quickly at a fast food restaurant. There's only one way that this is even remotely possible. And, it's not good. Both burgers arrived overcooked. The fries were just okay. We were in and out of there in less than 20 minutes. I don't mean that to sound like a positive. It isn't. I guess one is going to have to try it for themselves and hope they land in the universe that those 5 star reviewers reside in. All the best."

            "text": "What's surprising to me is that people still wait in line for 1 hour to get a table and get a, at best, mid burger. Our experience started off strong when we realized, after a 45 minutes wait, that our name was not on the list, probably mispronounced at some point so nobody notice. The guy promised to fit us in but after 15 more minutes that only happened when we insisted again. After this, it was a hard comeback, but we were willing to look passed the wait. The hamburger is nothing special, and the size makes it overpriced. The place is cash only, what adds and extra layer of inconvenience to the whole experience. The cherry on top was a 15 minutes wait for the check. There was not bad faith at any moment, just a service and food that is not up to the expectations."

After waiting nearly an hour for a table, we were only told after sitting down that the restaurant accepts cash only. We had just enough to cover the bill and leave a small tip, but unfortunately not enough time to go to the bank.\n\nAs we were leaving, our server confronted us and demanded a larger tip, which felt very unprofessional and disrespectful. We understand servers rely on tips, but they should be voluntary, not mandatory. It left a bad impression despite the good food."

We arrived 7pm on a Saturday (likely their peak).\n\nThey seem to move tables quickly but it felt like most tables are geared to parties or 4. My observation was that they seemed to be seating large parties A LOT faster than parties of 2. Maybe come with 4ish people, plan to go to a bar for a drink if waiting an hour, and/or come late (after 9pm).\n\nOtherwise great burger and fries!  Not sure I’d wait 2 hours again for it tho!"

Due to this strange interaction we both decided we did not want the third burger as we felt like the establishment did not deserve any more of our money if this is how they treat their customers.\nHe did not walk by us again until he had the burger in which I said we would not like it anymore and can we please have the bill.\nHe sighed and walked off angrily, clearly knowing and realising we were not happy with his service.\nHe came back with the bill which was $50 and we had $60 cash.\nI handed him the money and said can we please have $10 change.\nHe said “ what you’re not gonna tip?”\nI said $10 change please as I believe you give the customer there money back first then they leave a tip as they please.\nHe said “ what I don’t get 25%?”.\nI said $10 change please.\nHe came back and slammed the change on the table and walked off.\n\nThe behaviour prior to the tipping situation was already so hostile but to assume and demand a tip on the spot is so strange and he was so incredibly rude whilst saying these things to us.\nI do not understand how this man is working at this restaurant.\nI see previous bad reviews on here having a similar situation and I bet you it’s the same person.\n\nI have never left a bad review for a restaurant in my life but I have never experienced such awful behaviour from a waiter so I feel as though people should be warned before having your day ruined.\n\nTotally not okay and I will never be coming back here again after coming here for years."

            "text": "Had an extremely disappointing experience today at JG Melon.\nAfter waiting more than 40 minutes without receiving my order, I politely asked the server to follow up. Meanwhile, every table seated after me was served. When I stood up to inquire again, I was met with an aggressive server who raised his voice and told me to “sit and have patience.”\n\nI then asked to speak with the manager, who showed no interest in resolving the situation. In the end, I paid for my single glass of wine and left—never receiving my meal after nearly 50 minutes.\n\nThis is hospitality at its worst. Guests should feel welcome and respected, not ignored and berated. There are plenty of places in New York to get a burger, and sadly JG Melon has lost a loyal customer who has been coming for years"

A true “saloon with food,” it has been drawing locals and international crowds alike, from stars and politicians to artists, writers, and generations of families.\n\nI went for the cheeseburger cooked medium rare with bacon. It arrives deconstructed: the beef patty on one bun, the bacon on the other, with onions and pickles on the side. The patty was nicely cooked, juicy, and full of deep beef flavor. But the real standout? The bacon. Extra crispy, slightly salty, and adding the perfect crunch to every bite.\n\nJ.G. Melon is a local favorite and a must-visit for burger lovers. No sauces, no gimmicks, just an old-school burger done right. And a quick tip: they’re cash only, so come prepared."

Despite the late hour, the service was impressively quick, which we appreciated. Now, let’s talk about the food! I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, and wow, it was delicious. They definitely don’t skimp on the bacon, which was a delightful surprise! The burger had that classic, old-school vibe—simple and grilled to perfection, just like I remember.\n\nOn the flip side, the fries didn’t quite hit the mark for me. They were cut into chips and a bit too oily for my taste, so I think I’ll skip those next time.\n\nAll in all, it was a fun night out with great vibes and a fantastic burger.

The bun was well-buttered and perfectly toasted, the patty cooked to perfection and exactly to my medium rare request. The burger comes plated with pickles and red onions, letting you assemble it to your taste. Just the essentials done right.\nFrom the first bite, it was pure love! Juicy, flavorful, and unforgettable taste. It’s about a four-inch bun it packs an immense punch of flavor that stays with you hours later.\nThe atmosphere adds to the charm: cozy, pub-like, bustling with happy energy and dynamic. I went around 4 p.m., and even then the place was packed, which says it all. J.G. Melon is not just a burger spot, it’s truly a New York institution and for a reason! The staff is super fast, constantly moving and monitoring their customers and gives off friendly vibes.\nThis burger easily ranks among the best I’ve had in the city (and trust me, I’ve had many!). I can’t wait to go back and next time, I might add bacon, but today’s classic cheeseburger was perfection.\nA flavor so iconic it stayed with me for hours afterwards and honestly I keep thinking about it!"

The scent of sizzling patties and the sight of burgers constantly flying out of the kitchen send your brain into pre-meal overdrive.\n\nWe actually came here twice. The first time, we gave up — the wait was just too long. The second time, we got lucky and snagged a table after about 20 minutes. While waiting at the bar, I had time to take in the half-open kitchen and quirky décor. At least twenty thick patties were cooking at once, filling the air with that irresistible, savory aroma.\n\nThe melon-themed interior is full of character — think melon art, melon clocks, melon paintings. It feels like you’ve stepped into the eccentric collection room of a mischievous melon-obsessed boy. It’s weirdly charming and totally genuine.\n\nThen there’s the burger — the undisputed star of the show. It’s minimalist: just meat, cheese, and bread. Pickles and onions are served on the side. No lettuce, no tomato, no fancy sauces — just pure, unadulterated confidence in the quality of their beef. And they’re right to be confident. The patty is perfectly cooked — juicy, with just the right balance of fat and meat, slightly crispy on the outside, and tender inside. The fries? Also excellent.\n\nDespite how busy it was, the service stood out. No one rushed us to leave after we finished. In many popular spots, you can feel the pressure to free up your table — but not here.\n\nWhen we stepped outside, a cheerful crowd was still waiting. Everyone was smiling for some reason. Eating at JG Melon feels like a little festival, and I’d definitely come back — just for the vibe."

But tipping is supposed to be the customer's choice, not something the server dictates. Still, we were prepared to pay what he asked, but we were short by exactly $1 in cash.

Not wanting to be seen as a “difficult customer” over $1, I dug through my wallet and bag to come up with the last dollar.\nAs we were leaving, the server(an older man with glasses) deliberately ignored us.

Even though the hostess was welcoming and sat our party of 2 within 10min since we walked in, the waitress was rude, we felt rushed and not taken good care of.\n\nThe atmosphere is very cool there, you’d feel like you are in the 90th. It’s a real New York vibe! ❤️"

We waited in a line outside for around 45 to 60 min. The burgers were good, but not awesome as I personally expected. The service was ok, but it could be better. We saw people that got in line after us with the same # of people getting inside first. This kind of stuff also happened inside where people that sat later had their burgers before my table and the table that sat before ours. Our order also came missing bacon, but it was quickly solved after we report it."

We arrived shortly after they opened for lunch. Not busy, but definitely more and more crowded as we were eating. Service was fast. Food was great. Many food shows had described their burger and chill bowl - all true. Only imperfection was the seats were tight, and there wasn’t too much space between tables. But honestly most small diners/bars in the city have similar arrangements to fit more people."

            "text": "5/5 for sure. I have been on a short term secondment to NYC and in 6 weeks I’ve been to this restaurant three times. I’m a solo diner (and also a young woman) so I always found the prospect of dining solo at a bar (rightly or wrongly) really intimidating. The team make you feel like part of the furniture - enough to keep you comfortable but in no way overbearing. It is really relaxed and you do feel at ease. Onto the food- I had the burger twice and the steak once. Personally, I’d recommend the burger but I did enjoy the steak and also the salad (w blue cheese dip was delicious)! The staff here are all on their A-game and work really hard. They’re really professional and care about doing a good job- it’s very obvious. I can imagine it must be difficult to be doing these hours because it’s a late night spot but busy all day! Special shout out to Patrick behind the bar who took great care of me and even gave me the key-lime pie on the house (it’s a MUST! So delicious) I didn’t catch the name of the host or the Irish lady but they were also both great. Can’t wait to come back again! Thank you to the whole team! Long live JG Melon!"

The place is small and there is almost always a queue outside, so I would recommend coming here a bit before 12 or in the slower hours to not have to queue for too long. Service is good, and the food is pretty great! Definitely worth stopping by! The cheeseburger is the go to, and also the omelettes are really well done. The fries could do some improving."
