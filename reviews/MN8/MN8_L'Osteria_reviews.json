Overall pretty good, but the ravioli dough could have been thinner, and the bürste in the salad was quite cold, unpleasantly. The seasonal “tart” turned out a galette, ice cream not the best. Enjoyable atmosphere with dimmed lights, polite service."

However, when an ordinary place serves extremely small portions, it’s a real turn-off,  especially considering the high prices for such tiny servings."

From the time we arrived at the restaurant to the cappuccinos we ordered to complete the lunch, it was a delectable experience. The fresh ingredients, unique preparation, and authentic flavors made for such a palatable experience.\n\nWe recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys a delicious Italian food dining experience. We plan on visiting this place in the future for sure."

I got a bad feeling as soon as we walked in as we are not white and were dressed more casual. I am not a tourist, was born and raised in new york. The server lets us know they were completely booked and we have an option to sit at the bar.. to eat our pasta. This was said on a slow Tuesday afternoon either about 5-6 empty tables. Ofcourse we walked out of this establishment feeling horrible. Just a warning to not visit this place if you don’t want to feel bad about yourself. We just wanted good pasta and instead went to a Thai restaurant across the street where we were welcomed and respected."

The meat for the sausage is lean, juicy and freshly grounded. Mushrooms give the perfect kick umami.

I especially liked a slightly sour touch on all the homemade sauces - was never to an extreme but really well blended into the richness of other tastes the kitchen tried to convey.\n\nService was also great. We were 2 hours early (our fault) but the reception & the servers made it so we wouldn't be inconvenienced or treated any differently from the patrons that were enjoying the meal on time. The menu items were explained to us in a very professional manner. The place seemed to be a little short-staffed, but everything was handled efficiently & without any loss of courtesy, I thought.\n\nReally liked the atmosphere, either. It is a rather small-sized establishment catering mostly to the local population in the UES of NYC (I think). Was quite enough & I liked the fact that we had a lot of sun in during the day."

We had already eaten dinner, but we wanted a couple of drinks (read: rounds) to stay out. We came upon L’Osteria walking up Lexington and it was just the prescription for our disappointment. Andrew (“Wolf”) was a superb host to our two or three rounds, during which each member of the service staff made a point to greet us and make us feel welcome while we were sitting at the small bar. We didn’t end up pulling the trigger on Second Dinner with the Burrata or Meatballs, but we will be back- judging by the overly content smiles on the UES ladies faces dining behind us.\nWhat a great find. The lost art of hospitality, on a Saturday night nonetheless. Can’t wait to go back."
