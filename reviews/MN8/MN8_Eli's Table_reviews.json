One or two things were a little off (the gnocchi wasn’t the best) and some things seemed a little outrageous as far as pricing goes ($25 for fries, which only come with ketchup, if you’re going to charge me that much for fries at least make it exciting with various dipping sauces?). The wine list was great and everything we had to drink was perfect. Over all a nice experience"

Jeremy, the general manager, attentive to all of the customers, while his staff perform their jobs admirably.  I learned at the end of my meal, but the kind gentleman sharing a meal at a nearby table was the owner. This is a great neighborhood restaurants that also attracts those coming into town on a periodic basis. I’ll be back!"
