The upstairs area is beautifully decorated to look like a garden, but it’s all indoors, which makes it a perfect escape from the weather. The entrance is a bit hidden from the street, but it’s worth seeking out. The waitstaff can get a little overwhelmed, especially with how close the tables are, but they’re attentive and work hard to make the experience enjoyable. Definitely a spot I’d return to."

Their prices are expensive for pasta and pizza but you are spending for the atmosphere and location. An easy walk to the MET. The gnocchi was good. Their lobster ravioli is the real star on their menu, but it is a small serving for a $30 dish. The margarita pizza needs more basil and roma tomatoes, it should not include olives on the pizza. Their pistachio cake crust was soggy and it didn't taste fresh. Service was attentive. Overall a nice place after a long day @ the MET. Try the pistachio and coffee chocolates at the Parisian chocolatier next door!"

The service was just as bad: slow, inattentive, and unaccommodating. They even refused to let our 10-year-old order from the kids menu, which she actually wanted. Water came without ice, which summed up the overall lack of care. I don’t know whether the Google reviews are inflated or fake, but the Yelp score is much lower and probably more accurate. Would not recommend to anyone looking for good food or hospitality."

Be sure you really like it spicy because this one is hot, the only places that usually mean it are thai restaurants. We didn't have a reservation and were seated on the rooftop terrace which was kinda warm.  They also take inkind which is an app that let's you earn 20% back when you pay your bill.  Great deal!"

Fortunately, they had room for us,  so definitely make a reservation if you can. My wife had the 4 stagiani pizza (topped with tomato, mozzarella, mushrooms, artichokes, pesto & prosciutto), and I had the RAVIOLI DEGLI INNAMORATI (ravioli with lobster). Both were absolutely delicious! Out of all the restaurants we ate at, this was one of my favorites! Unfortunately, I didn't snap any pics of the food, but it was definitely good!"

Gnocchi was undercooked and kinda cold and on the contrary the ravioli was served piping hot which burnt my mouth. Seemed like frozen ravioli that was microwaved and added to a sauce.\n\nFood was average, could be better with either guidance from better chefs or some self innovation from the chef and cooks currently there.\n\nService was below average - The service manager was rude enough to not greet us and only talk to the staff that was seating us, we saw him a couple of times while in and out and the guy had negative body language. Our waiter seemed to be in a hurry to go back near the kitchen then attending us.\n\nAtmosphere was good on the lower floors but we were seated on the top floor which wasn’t as good as the floors below.\n\nPlace has potential but lacked motivation and soul !"

The portion size is smaller compared to other dishes. The truffle pizza was also not very worth the price in my opinion. It has a strong truffle flavor, I’ll give it that, but. The cheese was solid and not very melted, and there wasn’t much to the pizza except the solid cheese and truffle flavor. Gnocchi was pretty good, nothing special though. I liked the truffle ravioli and other pizza. Atmosphere is really lovely, great lighting and decor, especially on second floor. Service is good too! Overall would not come back because the food is not worth the price."

I recommend that you reserve in advance mainly because there’s no waiting area and you will end up having to queue on the narrow staircase leading up to the restaurant (not very comfortable). Luckily, we did have a reservations so we sat down immediately. The staff was very friendly and the service was quick! We were a party of 3 and we shared a margherita pizza (without olives) and we each had our own pasta dish: 2 of us had the black truffle ravioli dish and I had the Paglia E Fieno (fettucini with creamy tomato sauce). The pizza was phenomenal from crust to toppings! The 2 other people with me LOVED their ravioli dish and I also loved my fettucini dish. What I liked about my fettucini dish is that the homemade fettucini itself was really special and the portion was very generous! I ended up not having dinner that day! Highly recommend this place!"
