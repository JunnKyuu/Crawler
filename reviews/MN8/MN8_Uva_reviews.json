The service was excellent, super attentive and friendly.\nThe food was fresh and really good, and I found the prices to be very reasonable. The ambience was cozy and inviting, and since it’s almost Halloween, their decorations definitely added to the vibe.\nOverall, great experience, good food, great service, and a fun atmosphere. Well done! 👏"

Because I prefer sweet wines and drinks and every time, I have tried a \"sweet\" wine from UVA, well, it wasn't. They were always dry, and I don't like it at all. The food has never failed, and the aesthetic is absolutely stunning! I went last week and it's Halloween dressed but it's still classy. I will be returning!"

I understand a short, few minute wait but that was crazy. It begs the question what’s the point of making a reservation in the first place?\n\nInside was extremely busy and deafeningly loud. The tables were tiny and way too small for the amount of plates, glasses and bottles on the table.\n\nThe vibe was cosy and spookily decorated for Halloween but it was just too crowded to enjoy it properly. At times, my server could not hear me and I had to shout to give my order.\n\nThe olive oil they serve with the bread is very tasty; the dried meats were good, but sliced very thinly. The calamari was ok; the predominant flavour was a burnt herb.\n\nThe menu is pretty big but the portions are rather small. I had the pappardelle ragu; the pasta itself was lovely and wonderfully cooked, but I found the ragu flavourless.\n\nThey have a good wine selection and are happy to make your cocktail of choice if they have the ingredients. Service was a little slow.\n\nAll in all, it was decent, but I was definitely expecting a lot more."

The pizza style focaccia is akin to a Schwan’s frozen pizza. 4 sip cocktails over hotel style ice at $19 sit right with the overpriced theme as do the pasta portions. Sadly very underwhelming for dinner. Brunch is much better all round, with better portions and better flavor, but I’d advise to skip dinner. Overpriced and average at best."

The restaurant itself is very cozy, but unfortunately, the food was pretty disappointing.\n\nWe ordered the beef carpaccio, which had barely any beef — it was mostly arugula and cheese. The pappardelle with veal ragu tasted oddly like it had potatoes in it (I think those were actually big chunks of carrot). We also tried the short ribs, which were quite bland and tasted as if they’d been boiled before serving.\n\nThere are so many great restaurants in the UES, so I’d skip Uva for the food."

I can never come here without ordering the truffle gnocchi—it’s rich, flavorful, and honestly hard to beat anywhere else. The gorgonzola pear salad was light, refreshing, and very good. The meatballs were just okay—small in size (six per order, good for sharing) with a sauce that tasted more onion-forward than I remember. Not bad, but not a standout.\n\nService is consistently strong—the food came out quickly, our waitress was attentive, and the whole staff is always accommodating. A neighborhood staple for a reason."

Both my friend and I ordered the truffle pasta, and when the bill came, we were surprised to see it was $45 per plate - $90 just for the pasta. That’s on me for not asking the price, but they really should have made it clear on the menu.\n\nIn total, with one drink each, a shared salad, and the main courses, the bill came to $146 before tip - over $175 with a 20% tip. It's a cute place, but not worth that much money."

They refuse to bring you bread until after you order your entrée. The appetizers came in four minutes, proving that nothing was made to order. It tasted microwave hot. The oil used for frying was old and bitter. The waitstaff was kind of rude and impatient. The pasta sauce tasted like it was made with  cheap tomato paste. It had that cheap, bitter aftertaste. The duck was so tough that it wasn’t chewable. The menu does a terrible job describing the food that they bring you. Literally nothing about the experience was good or noteworthy. I have no idea why this place is so crowded. There are so many mediocre Italian places on the upper east side. All of them are better than this."

            "text": "My friend and I were so excited to come to Uva for the first time on a Saturday night. We have both lived on the UES and had never been. So, we were thrilled when we got a reservation for 7:45 on a Saturday! We were greeted by a very friendly host and were seated immediately. Then we met our waitress…who couldn’t have been less friendly…\nHer tone and demeanor towards us was unfriendly from the moment she came to take our drink order. Our food took over 40 minutes to come out and after we ordered our appetizers, she did not come to check on us once…while we saw her tending to other tables and saw other tables that arrived after us get their orders before we did, as well as multiple rounds of drinks. By the time our food finally came out, I was starved. It was clear they forgot about us and scrambled to get our food out quickly. The shrimp in my pasta were grey..clearly not fully cooked. My pasta was drastically under-seasoned. Our waitress, again, avoided us. Didn’t come over to ask if we were happy with our food. By the time we had finished eating what we could, we asked for the check before they had even cleared our plates. I don’t know what was going on and I can’t remember the last time I had a BAD meal in NYC…until today. I was beyond disappointed by UVA. A place I have been dying to try for years. It’s safe to say I’ll never be coming back and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."

Pappardelle and Gnocchi Ricotta were our main dishes after a delicious salad (Bianca) and polpettine. Delicious, full of flavor and obviously using the correct ingredients as we did not feel drowsy afterwards (seems to be an issue with Italian places in our experience - maybe an issue California?). Finished our meal with real gelato and a torta di mandorle (almond tart). Ambiance? The place is quite dark but luckily we were able to sit at the back patio which helped a LOT.

The pasta dishes never disappoint, but the standout is the ricotta gnocchi, served in a decadent black truffle and chive sauce--creamy, flavorful, and unforgettable. Another must-try is the melanzane alla parmigiana, a comforting eggplant parmesan reminiscent of lasagna, but lighter and just as satisfying. With its warm ambiance and top-notch food, UVA is the perfect spot for date nights and great vibes!"

Loved that I could order half a portion of a pasta cause I wasn’t feeling like eating too much after the apps, so you have that option. Prices were a bit higher than I expected.\n\nService was ok. Server made good recommendations and gave a good service overall."

The restaurants felt sufficiently staffed though, and there was absolutely no service issue, in fact, it was fantastic.\n\nUva has a very romantic vibe to it, and as inviting as their cocktail and wine list looked, our dry January had comfortably flowed into March, so we got straight to ordering our dinner which included their ROBIOLA CHEESE AND BLACK TRUFFLES ($12) and POLENTA TARTUFATA ($19) as appetizers - both absolutely fantastic, but the Robiola being the winner.\n\nFor mains, we got a few pastas including RIGATONI ALLA SICILIANA ($26), CAVATELLI AL FIOR DI PESTO ($26), and PENNE GRATINATE ($26) - Cavatelli being an absolute winner!\n\nTheir desserts though were really fantastic, especially their TIRAMISU ($11) which was very delicious.

But this one was sooo different makes you want to come back; plus many of the options are vegetarian and mouth watering.

Perhaps it’s not so hidden anymore since the pandemic, as they have the largest space for outdoor dining I’ve seen so far...\nPre-covid they were always busy and I had always had to make a reservation in advance, but now they have so many tables set up that you can go without making a Rez. I went on a Tuesday night and it was packed, having to wait 15 minutes, which wasn’t so bad at all.\nThe staff is friendly and the food is excellent. Also since Covid, they have you scan a barcode to view the menu which is nice.\n\nI’ve tried a few different dishes here but most recently had the Bigoletti di Barbabietole and tried the Rigatoni alla Siciliana, with the Brussels sprouts as a side. All were delicious.\n\nRegarding drinks, my friend and I tried the Red Sangria and the Pinacolada first. I wasn’t a hugee fan of the sangria as it just tasted like regular red wine, and the pinacolada was on the average side - wasn’t really a fan of the coconut flakes in it. We also tried the margaritas, which were good. They weren’t like a classic margarita but I did like them because they were a little bit different.\n\nThe food is what really stands out here, and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for delicious Italian food."

The burrata appetizer is also good and beautifully plated.\nOnly downside is that it does get very noisy when packed and the tables are very close to eachother, making noise unavoidable. However, the great food makes up for it. Definitely one of the best spots in NYC."

            "text": "We were seated quickly but it wasn’t a particularly warm welcome. It took ages for our server to introduce himself, meanwhile he was taking orders from tables seated after us. Order-taking was efficient to the point of being brusque. Questions were answered, but answered tersely. No one was rude and we were taken care of, but it felt oddly rushed and transactional for an old-school Italian spot.\n\nThe food was good but not so outstanding I’d make a special trip for it.\n\nThe grilled shrimp was fresh and well cooked, although the avocado, tomato and palm heart salad was a little underwhelming. The burrata was admittedly awesome in both flavor and presentation, with the fava bean accompaniment surprising me with how well it paired with the cheese. The gnocchi di ricotta was good but a little heavy for my taste, but that’s probably on me. (I have no idea what the other reviewer complaining about portion size is talking about; the portions were so big I couldn’t finish.)\n\nThe garden space is nice, though cramped, and the chairs were a little uncomfortable. It was also louder than I expected (with another large party in the space), so it wasn’t quite as relaxed and romantic as I was picturing in my head when I suggested the place to my family.\n\nOne thing I will say is that the prices seem outrageously high for what you get. I know NYC is expensive and people have to make a living, but $27 for a bowl of gnocchi? For the prices we paid, I’m accustomed to much better service and surroundings than what we got here.\n\nOverall, it was… fine? Nothing was obviously bad, certainly not enough to say anything, but nothing was great either. Comparing our experience to other reviews, it seems something must have been off the day we came.\n\nIf I’m in the area again I wouldn’t object to coming back for another try, but I think I’d try the other nearby options first."

We were seated right away, and the food came extremely fast, which was great. Unfortunately the bread was cold, the food was bland, and the staff was extremely inattentive. Overall the sangria was ravioli were ok."

They offer cheese plates and Italian cuisine. The food was just okay. I didn't have any pasta I will admit though. I did have the bruschettas which were fine and the pear and gorgonzola salad with chicken added which wasn't special. Favorite part was the chocolate salami dessert. Very tasty and easy to share at a table of multiple guests.\n\nTo me it is more about the atmosphere. Grab a reservation though, we were there on a Tuesday night and it was packed!"
