            "text": "I’m extremely upset with the repeated issues I’ve had with this location. I’ve ordered from here at least 6–8 times, and almost every single time, something is missing. Today, I even called the store right after placing my order to confirm that everything would be correct — yet they still forgot two items.\nWhat makes it worse is that this time, they didn’t even apologize for the mistake. In the past, I’ve also had an order arrive a day late after being assured by the manager it would come the same day. It’s extremely frustrating and disappointing because the food itself is very good, but the constant mistakes and lack of accountability ruin the experience."

            "text": "I got a 6oz lobster roll, a 6oz crab roll, and a 8oz  cup of lobster bisque.\n\nThe rolls were soft and sweet, and it was nicely toasted. The lobster meat was fresh and clean tasting. The crab meat was also pretty nice, too. They put just right amount of seasoning on the top. It was enough to enhance the flavor, and not too much to be overpowering. They were good rolls.\n\nI was only worried about two things when I have seafood. One is that the food was not fresh and fishy, and the other was there were shells in it. They did the fresh part very nicely, however, I did find 3 tiny pieces of shell in my crab roll. I guess it was inevitable, so all is good.\n\nThe lobster bisque was quite nice, too. It was thick and flavorful. It was a bit too salty to my liking. There was one chunk of lobster claw in the bisque.\n\nOverall, the food was nice. The service was meh, I ordered online, and when I go pick it up the server didn’t even mention to grab my own chips that were included in my meal. I found out when I was walking across the street, and I had to go back and ask for it."

My bread was so soggy i took one bite and had no choice but to discarded my meal & it was the last $20 i had. my crab roll was disappointing & my favorite item of the meal * the bun * was ruined with the crab water. my entire bun pretty much soaked up everything and it was displeasing to the touch. especially since i have sensory issues. Lukes is my favorite so i dont want this to be the reason i dont eat it no more but please do better\n\nSo 9/13/24..   i experienced the same incident But A nice & accommodating lady ensured my food was correctly fixed & made to my liking. i really appreciated how she actively listened to my issue,resolved the issue & gave me fresh food without ANY pushback . i really do appreciate your help today , i really wish i got her name. she was amazing !"

NOT here.\n\nYes, the portion size is slightly small for the price BUT the flavour more then compensates for it.\n\nThe lobster Mac and Cheese, on the other hand, lacked much lobster. There were only two pieces in ours, in fact. But the m&c was creamy and soft so it wasn’t bad overall, just expected more lobster.\n\nStaff are super friendly and amazing too!"

Better for a lunch or someone who prefers a smaller portion.\n\nDecor was inviting, small place, normal service. Hybrid of casual fast food and sit down style (waited 8-12 min for food to come out). It’s in the category of ‘am I suppose to tip or not?’\n\n5* for the lobster roll quality and visual appearance of food.\n4* for the rest of the food and atmosphere\n3* for the price to portion ratio ($$$ is probably more accurate)"

And yep, strategically always good for sharing everything! Their bisque was deliciously comforting. The lobster mac & cheese was actually surprisingly really good. Hubby enjoyed the crab roll and I also loved the lobster roll. They have a small outdoor dining area outside and on a beautiful not so cold evening, this was absolutely perfect!\n\nStaff were also great. Polite, smiling, actually liked taking care of customers type. May actually use that loyalty card as it works for UWS branches too! On our way out, we waved and thanked the team who took care of us, with a quick thumbs up! Thanks guys!

It’s entirely possible that I closed my eyes as I took each bite.\n\nLuke’s is pricey (to be expected since it’s quality seafood in Manhattan), but I like that they offer incentives.

For $13 I felt like it deserved a bit more lobster.\n\nFast forward a few months and here I was hesitant to go back to try the lobster roll but noticed they also had a shrimp roll on the menu so I decided to gave that a shot. I have to say, the shrimp roll was pretty good."

It's already expensive as is ($24 for a trio with fries and drink) and I felt swindled by their tipping practice especially since they don't even have table service here.\n\nOne this one particular experience it took over 20 minutes to get my food. A group of four had arrived 5 minutes after me and had not only gotten their food first but had also finished eating before my meal was even brought out to me.\n\nHowever, I do like the ambience and I'm a fan of Luke Lobster's buttered rolls so that's the only reason why I didn't give this place a one star review."

As for the lobster roll, why is it so cold? Even the toasted bread is cold. Would be much more delicious is it's hot and freshly made, feels pre-made and left in fridge."
