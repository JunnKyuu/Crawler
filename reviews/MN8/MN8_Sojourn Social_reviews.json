Both drinks were delicious and pretty strong!\n\nWe also ordered long Island Duck Croquettes. It was nice and crispy, but I wasn’t sure what it was really. The sauce was nice and had a punch from the mustard.\n\nWe also got a Chef’s Special Burger cook medium well and a 30 days dried aged ribeye steak cooked medium rare. The bacon in the burger was cooked to perfection. It was nice and crispy, and not greasy at all. The ribeye was also tender and flavorful. Everything was very nice.\n\nThe servers were nice and friendly. However, the music was quite loud and it was very hard to talk. Everyone was basically yelling in order to have a conversation. Overall, it was a very nice restaurant."

It was completely flat and despite being over ice, tasted warm. If you don’t have a soda fountain at your restaurant that’s fine…BUT BUY CANS OR INDIVIDUAL GLASS BOTTLES!"

I absolutely love that it’s dog-friendly—they even have a fun and well-organized puppy happy hour that adds such a unique touch. The decor is stylish and welcoming, and the patio is a perfect spot to relax, especially with a furry friend.\n\nI recently attended a dog-themed event here and was seriously impressed with how smoothly everything was run. Not only is it a great spot for drinks, but the food was surprisingly good too. Our meals came out quickly, fresh, and exactly as ordered. Everyone in my group was happy with their dishes, and the couple next to us even complimented the staff on how efficient and friendly they were.\n\nI ordered a mimosa, which was perfectly mixed and super refreshing. The service throughout our visit was warm and attentive—even during the busy rush, the staff made sure we were taken care of with smiles and genuine hospitality. It's clear they care about the customer experience, and it really shows. As someone who’s worked in the restaurant industry, I appreciate the level of professionalism and heart this place offers. Can’t wait to come back again!"

I especially like how dog friendly this place is. This is why I brought my dog to dine in their outside patio. There's a front patio with several dining spots and the outdoor patio has covered dining in little mini private booths and tables about the backyard, multi-level spaces. There's string lights, fake greenery. It feels like you're someplace not in the middle of the city. I love love loved this spot.\nService (5/5): They brought a Bark-cuterie for my dog and provided constant refills for her too! We were helped throughout the dining experience and waitress was super sweet when I asked her what the cola spritz was. When asked what the M&M shot was, she also kindly got me one even though I didn't order from the menu when my friend did! It was super sweet!\nFood (5/5): We came for their Thursday specials $10 aerprols: THERSy day for a girl dinner of coke aerprol, Caesar salad, and M&M shot. I decided to go for their summer special of a salmon on a bed of quinoa 'risotto' corn. The presentation was beautiful! The salmon had a nice sear and was cooked to a medium-rare which made the fish very tender.\nCan't wait to come back again!"

Good vibes, great bites, and the cocktails were so creative and perfectly executed they were so yummy and delicious I can’t wait to go back, the pups were lounging and when we arrived at our table we found a spot and tango treat sample bag, a little soap gift set for the moms and raffle tickets it was soo cute and thoughtful. The menu made both humans and fur babies feel spoiled. The Caesar Salad was crisp and punchy, the Duck Rillette Croquettes were rich little bites of heaven, and the Arugula & Radicchio salad brought the perfect bitter crunch. I couldn’t resist the Coque Madame (hello, cheesy perfection) while my fiancée swore the Eggs Benedict was the best he’s had in ages. The pups enjoyed the carrots and prosciutto. The staff was so sweet (to us and the dogs) they make you feel like regular even if it’s your first time there like us. We sat outdoors and the atmosphere strikes the perfect balance between cozy and vibrant it was so laid-back but full of energy it was full of happy pups with tail wags all around. My pups made new friends, and we all left with full bellies and happy hearts. 10/10, would wag and brunch again already counting down to the next one!"

He had an attitude when they brought my meal and it differed from what they stated it entailed on the menu. They have random secret rules where they don’t make things during lunch time but didn’t inform the customer or the server apparently. That being said, my duck was great. The fried rice they made was also really good. The drinks have adorable names that mimic songs and books. The happy hour deal is nice and the drinks are tasty. It’s worth visiting if you can avoid that server that tried to ruin my graduation day."

We opted to sit outside, and I’m so glad we did. The outdoor seating area is beautifully set up, offering a comfortable and lively space that really enhances the overall vibe.\nOne of the highlights of our meal was the Caesar salad. It was simple, crisp, and flavorful — the kind of dish that reminds you why classics stay classic. Fresh romaine, just the right amount of dressing, and a generous dusting of parmesan made it really satisfying without being too heavy.\nWhat truly stood out, though, was the service. Our waitress went above and beyond to accommodate us when we asked about a specific menu item that wasn’t technically available. She checked with the kitchen and made it happen without hesitation, which made us feel especially taken care of. It’s that kind of attention to detail that makes a place memorable.\nWhether you’re looking for a casual lunch or a laid-back dinner with friends, Sojourn Social delivers on food, service, and setting. I’ll definitely be coming back."

Great for a date night, girls/guys night. Not too crowded, not too loud, but a perfect city restaurant right on 2nd Ave where the hustle & bustle awaits.\n\nWe went on a Friday in Sojvember at 6 leaving us one hour to enjoy happy hour. 2 for 1 drinks & those baby’s were strong. Delicious yes, but strong & that’s exactly how we like it! You can also get small plates for $7 but we were hungry & went straight to the menu!\n\nWe had the calamari to start which was fresh & tasted like it. The marinara sauce for dipping was also really good. (Note to Chef/Manager the Fra Diavolo sauce with the Squid Ink Tortellini would go crazy as a dipping sauce for the calamari or drizzle of coating on top. Thank me later.) I ordered the Skirt Steak & he ordered the Duck Breast. Honey baby love both were delicious. I’m not that well versed in duck but it had the sear of a steak with the flavor/texture that resembled chicken & while that my sound crazy, I promise you it was amazingggg & the fried rice that it came with?? I should’ve ordered some on the side to go. That steak? Grilled perfectly, nailed the temperature on the cook, the chimmichurri was delectable & that ginger ketchup(could bottle & sell tbh) were the perfect accompaniment for those golden fries.\n\nAll in all? Yes. I’ll absolutely be back for happy hour, brunch & to try other items on their menu. So happy to have a place that’s my own 🥰"

The ambiance, the food and the SERVICE. Exceptional service is still alive in the city. From the moment we walked in we knew it was the right choice to not change up the plan. Shoutout goes to Emily!\n\nWe had a ceasar salad, candied pecan arugula salad, skirt steak chimichurri, island faroe salmon, dark chocolate brownie, ricotta cheesecake and a couple of drinks, all while watching the games that were on that night. Just an overall great experience. Highly recommend."

I entertained one of my most valuable clients in the private room and from start to finish they catered to all of my needs and then some. We had so much fun it brought me back to my 20's as we stayed for over 4 hours. Looking forward to our excursion!!!"

They treat you like family from the moment you walk in, always going above and beyond to make every visit special. The food is absolutely incredible and the drinks are just as tasty and fun. It’s my happy place in the UES and the first place I take anyone who visits NYC. I literally have people who request it now when they come back into town - cannot say enough good things!!!"

I had a French 75  or at this establishment a  Lorazapam Lemonade.  Usually it is served in a champange glass.  Not  here.. a full wine glass.  The drinks are strong and good.    Now the food.. I only had the wings.. good but tough, same as most establishments.  Overall I would say this is a place to be!"

After inquiring about our burgers,  which we could clearly see, our server told us to be lucky we got our drinks since everyone was waiting. \"It'll be a long time!\" When they discovered our food on a neighboring table,  in full view of our table,  they said nothing about the mixup. I'm pretty sure we were served those same burgers. Never got the 2nd order of drinks we ordered. We had to chase the server for basics like ketchup and utensils. I hope this was an off night,  but I'll never know. I won't be back. Not even for the pineapple rum old fashioned,  which was super tasty!"
