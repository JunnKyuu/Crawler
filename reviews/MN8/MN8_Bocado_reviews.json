It isn't obnoxious with 500 TVs blaring in your face, and the servers are very attentive. I believe it's only wine and beer at the bar, but it's a good place if you just want to chat with friends and catch up :) They have a decent selection of food as well- I was very satisfied with the pesto rigatoni"

Bocado was not my initial restaurant of choice, but finding that one full I remembered this was nearby. I am so glad I did! The food was phenomenal! I had the grilled steak with fingerling potatoes and asparagus. Everything was cooked to perfection. This might have been the best steak I’ve had in months. The service was OK. And if the weight staff had been a bit more attentive to the diminishing level of my drink, this restaurant easily could have gotten a full 5-stars. As it turned out, this meal was the best part of the evening, because the performance of Shakespeare was sadly disappointing."

Still, would return as a special outing with friends for good food at a convenient location with good ambiance.\nPictured: crab cake burger, omelettes, eggs Benedict."

I had the pear salad with chicken, my sister had the Fish and Chips (appetizer version)- which was quite large and filling. They have an extensive wine menu so if you're also looking for a refreshing, crisp glass of wine, Bocado is a great pick. My favorite part of this restaurant was not only the food, but the ambiance and decor throughout. We are glad we found this restaurant!"

I am unsure if this is some purist mentality for omelettes but I am not for it, and for $25 I was shocked by the lack of flavor. Only thing that my food had going for it was the dressing for my arugula salad and the toast with butter\n\nService was good but felt like I was being rushed out the door when already standing putting on my coat.\n\nI’m going to start implementing a rule because a trend I have noticed with more expensive restaurants is the food is more lackluster. My theory is that restaurants that can afford to set lower prices for food is because their food is good, popular, and able to compensate with high volume and sales to make up for lower price."

The salad dressing was very nice and not overpowering. The burger patty was thick and juicy, and they were very generous with the avocado slices and cheese. The steak and frites were very good. The steak was well seasoned and very tender. The frites were nice crispy and thick. I was able to taste the slightly sweetness of the potatoes. The roasted carrots were nice, too. Tiramisu was very delicious. Overall, it was a nice meal, but spent more money than I expected."

Our coffees and water were refilled without having to ask, which was appreciated. However, I found it off-putting when the waiter asked if we wanted the check while we were still enjoying our food. It felt a bit rushed and could have been handled more tactfully.\nFood: The food had its ups and downs. The French toast, served with maple syrup on the side, was satisfying and met expectations. However, the avocado toast with poached eggs fell short. It lacked seasoning, leaving it bland and unremarkable. Additionally, the side salad accompanying the dish was uninspired, lacking flavor and freshness.\nOverall, while the ambiance and some aspects of the service were enjoyable, the inconsistency in the food quality detracted from the overall experience."
