Everything was delicious and the service was top notch, not rushing us to finish our wine. Much appreciated. We will be back! Wonderful experience"

As mentioned already, I have small kiddos. They were doing their best- my three year old coloring and my one year old - being one- wiggling- always hungry without the words to express it- and an unkind woman decided it was appropriate to let me knowing we were disrupting not only her experience at the restaurant but everyone else’s. She also proceeded to walk past us saying “losers”, ignore me when o tried to speak with her on her way back from calling us losers, and throw the sweet drawing my three year old handed her on the ground before we headed out.. now that is all to say that while she was awful, the restaurant- the food and care we were given despite being more high maintenance that I would have liked- were amazing! The staff had seen what had happened and treated our family with the utmost care- letting us know that we were welcome there, not just in word but in kindness- crayons for my daughter to use, desert. They made what was an awful encounter very special. While we don’t go out to eat very often (see small children) we will definitely be back. Thank you all so much for your care. It made a tremendous difference and you have our patronage."

The atmosphere inside of Cafe d'Alsace is warm & inviting, and the staff are incredibly kind. Specifically, Edgar took excellent care of my group during our visit! :-) Their food + cocktails are delicious. For drinks, their Smoky Paloma is SO good (I highly recommend if you're looking for something within the realm of a tequila/mezcal base). For food, we all tried their Early Dinner Prix Fixe. For a starter, their Butternut Squash Soupe du Jour was a 10/10. For a main, their Grilled Scottish Salmon was so, so delicious (I added a side of their mashed potatoes as well, which was a great choice)!! For dessert, their Homemade Ice Cream & Sorbet were excellent closures to each of our meals. This is a great spot on the UES, definitely go see them!"

            "text": "Stopped by for a cosy brunch on a Saturday - the two of us managed to snag a res the evening before, but they did seem Quite busy, so definitely plan ahead!\n\nWe ordered eggs benedict and shakshuka to share. We opted for the bistro ham for the eggs benedict and it was very delicious! The eggs were poached very nicely and I really liked the sides (potatoes and salad both very yummy).\n\nShakshuka was also pretty good, flavour profile with all the spices mixed with the slightly roasted/smokey tomato was nice, would also recommend this dish. I wish they gave more bread hehe\n\nPortion size was fairly big -- we didn't quite finish, but also perhaps our appetites were a bit small -- and I think the overall price point was quite fair for the quality and quantity of food.\n\nThat being said, from these two dishes specifically there was nothing that particularly stood out as unique or spectacular in the universe of UES brunch places. I'd be keen to come back to try some other choices!"

Mussels were very, very tiny.\n\nOur server spilled quite a bit of water when pouring in my glass, but no apologies or attempt to clean up. He made sure we closed the bill when his shift was over, though. Don't think I'll go out of my way to come back."

The menu was impressive, and I particularly enjoyed the rich flavors of the pheasant sausage and the delicate seared skate fish. The restaurant's atmosphere was charming, and the staff provided impeccable service. Definitely worth a visit in the future."
