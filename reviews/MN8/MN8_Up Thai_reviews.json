Not expecting much, we were tooling down 2nd Ave and suddenly there was this place with a herd of souls waiting for take out. Remembering the name from Beli, in we went and plonked au bar managed by a nifty slinger of drink. The chef’s special was an ambrosial heap of seared beef raised to heavenly heights by  bouquets of mint, basil, tender salad fixings and a sublime bathing in a sauce that beggared description. The noods were a knock out, planetary pad Thai btw. Even more takeoutees were swarming when we left. Right you are if heading for Up Thai. You can’t go wrong."

My friends and I had some really lovely cocktails and their teas that are served with the pot is super comforting and very aromatic. The place is lovely but it's a little loud since they're so busy on a Saturday night, but that's certainly a good problem to have :)\nThat said, the service was... fine. But the reservation was in my name and as I was speaking to the hostess she did not look at me once and only looked at my friends. Our waiter was cool but he wouldn't let us keep the drink menu? They also apparently have a weird rule that you're only allowed two cups if you order the tea. We were a party of 3 and when I asked for another cup our waiter told us no. I totally respect businesses setting limits on sharing and stuff, but it was just treated really weirdly and made me feel guilty for even asking in the first place."

Everything was fine until a homeless man, seemingly struggling with mental health issues, started shouting and causing a disturbance nearby. He was loud and inappropriate, completely ruining the mood. We tried to finish our meal quickly and leave.\nTo add to that, I had ordered a whiskey on the rocks, but the bartender served it mixed with soda and water—and they refused to replace it.\nThe food itself was quite good, but overall, the experience was disappointing. Lesson learned: never sit outside in NYC."

I don’t recommend because it’s only fried wings with a side of chili wings. Nothing special about the wings so I was kind of disappointed. Honestly, the other food we got( tom yum, fish and pork belly) was alright. Got the pomelo salad which was my favorite. Got the Yuzu lemonade which has some kind of carbonation which was fine. The waitress name Jenn is great. Jenn was on top of everything including making sure our water was always filled which i appreciate so much! I like the restaurant due to the attentive staff and ambiance. In terms of food, I think it was alright. Our bill came out to be around $111 before tip.\n\nI do want to mention, the hostess is in front of the restaurant. Tonight was pretty chilly and I feel bad for her. I hope she gets paid well enough cause being a hostess is not easy. The hostess did a very good job multi tasking as I was observing. It was very busy tonight. I saw a girl behind her, not sure what her role was but i thought she could have been doing more in helping the hostess or something. The hostess looks pretty stressed out lol"

The host and the place is warm and welcoming but what won us over were the cocktails and food.\nOne of the drinks, with a floating banana leaf and crispy Jasmine rice ball on the top was theatrical on the eyes as well as the pallette. Highly recommend going for the house special of the season.\nThe dessing on the beef salad was very well balanced. And I would have married the soft crab in the cocount curry if we had not scraped the bowl for the last drop of that flavorful curry.\nThe staff attended to us with utmost care and made the whole experience enjoyable. This is definitely worth a visit."

I would recommend the place for sure.\n\nService was fast, food was plated well, portions were large for the price, and most importantly tasty.\n\nI would definitely recommend trying the Thai iced tea lemonade, a wonderful flavor combination I haven’t had before.\n\nI will be back."

            "text": "Another great Thai restaurant in NYC! The flavors weren’t mind-blowing or life-changing, but everything was executed very well.\n\nWe got the mango avocado salad, the clay-pot fried rice, and the soft shell crab in red curry from the summer menu.\n\nOur favorite was probably the mango avocado salad—it had a perfect level of spice and acidity to complement the rest of the meal. The clay pot fried rice was a bit underwhelming for me. Although the blend of different types of meat offered great textures, the flavor was uniform throughout the entire dish—everything tasted like sweet soy sauce or eel sauce. The soft shell crab curry was great and tasted just as expected."

If you go, try to sit inside; the interior ambiance is really nice and adds to the experience.\nThe only downside was that the restaurant handles a high volume of takeaway orders, which meant our food took over 30 minutes to arrive."

The mango salad with fish was crispy. Basil chicken rice had a kick to it but not too spicy. Moo dang was a delicious dish."

            "text": "I ordered three dishes for the table, including the Clay Pot rice, Pad Thai, and steamed mussels. Every dish was a hit. My favorite was the clay pot rice, a definite must have!!\n\nThe dishes tend to be sweet, but my mom felt it tasted too salty, so there’s definitely a cultural component to how you might perceive the food. When we arrived, it was starting to get busy (around ~5-5:30), so the workers started to set up a second location for dine in. My group of three ended up on one of the outside tables by this second location. I really appreciate Up Thai’s interior design so I was a little disappointed with not being able to show my family inside. Otherwise, dining outside went really smoothly. Servers paid thorough attention to customers outside, so I did not feel like we were lacking anything in comparison to sitting inside. In fact, one of the waiters reminded my family that Clay Pot rice was best enjoyed mixed, so they are pretty attentive to detail."

The Menu is phenomenal, we had the short rib and soft shell crab on the summer special menu and everything was 10/10. The only thing I regret is not getting the mango salad branzino, but I will be back!! Thank you so much to Salina, for being so helpful with answering any questions we had and making wonderful recommendations! Salina really added to our overall positive experience! The chefs menu is also stellar. This is my new Thai go to spot, also affordablish prices!"

            "text": "We made a reservation, and upon arrival, the host greeted us warmly with a lovely smile and seated us immediately. The atmosphere was beautiful, the decor was satisfying to look at, and the ambiance was wonderful as well.\n\nIt took our server a little while to greet us and bring water. He didn’t say hello and went straight to taking our order. He wasn’t rude, but a more welcoming approach would have made the experience better.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the duck roti roll and the calamari. The calamari was slightly overcooked, and the breading was falling apart — but the flavor was still great. We felt the duck roti roll had too much cucumber compared to the amount of duck, and the duck itself could have used a bit more seasoning.\n\nFor our entrées, we had the crispy duck Pad Thai from the lunch special, which was absolutely delicious. However, the dumpling that came with it lacked flavor and had a slightly mushy texture. We also tried the Pia Saam Ross (branzino with vegetables), which was phenomenal — flavorful, tangy, sweet, and spicy all at once.\n\nThe presentation of each dish was perfect — it looked like pure art. We were also very pleased with the service overall, especially since the staff kindly addressed an issue we had with one of our dishes.\n\nThank you so much — we will definitely be back again!"

Friendly staff large menu which includes alcohol, makes this a great spot for many occasion.\n\nThe food was great and the spice level actually hits normal standards not holding back at all. The papaya salad, green curry were great and the Branzino which was completed my deboned was also a hit with our group. The Thai tea is a bit o. The sweeter side but the tea flavors still came thru."

Service was friendly and efficient.\n\nWe ordered Pad Thai with shrimp and Crispy branzino with mango salad. The noodles and shrimp were perfectly cooked. Loved the mango salad. It was delicious and refreshing. However, the branzino fillets were over-fried and very hard instead of being crispy.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the lunch but would not order crispy dishes again."

We all got the lunch special which was a soup or salad, plus a small app, and a big main dish for 16-21 USD. It is very busy from 12-2 but after 2 is the perfect time it really cleared out. For price and quality this hits the 5/5 category. We waited for our seat at the stumble inn down the road and they had happy hour 4 bucks for draft beer so also super recommended for your stop to wait."
