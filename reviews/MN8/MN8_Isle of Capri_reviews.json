There is an extensive menu here, we enjoyed the chicken Parmesan, sauteed shrimp, and the veal Parmesan, great portions... esp since we were so hungry!! Served fresh and hot, along with the complimentary bread and bruscetta. A great neighborhood find with a charming atmosphere. Enjoy!"

The restaurant gives off an intimate vibe with old-style decor and comfortable seating. It felt like a restaurant out of an old movie scene. The staff is very attentive and friendly. They were able to give us good suggestions off the menu and served us with a smile.\n\nThey started us off with some warm bread and butter but we didn't even eat that much since our order came out so quick. My party ordered the eggplant and chicken parm, and let me tell you that eggplant parm was out of this world. The thin and crispy eggplant layered with cheese and sauce just melted in my mouth. I would go back just to order more of that. Since I am vegetarian, I didn't get to try the chicken parm but my friend devoured the entire dish, so I'm assuming it was very good.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean and spacious. They have private seating as well as main floor seating. Parking is difficult to find near the restaurant so try to walk or come by subway.\n\n5 stars!"

The hostess was very friendly, and the waiters were quick to refill water, recommend specific items and drinks, and stay nearby for anything we might need. Talk about above and beyond!\n\nWe got the Spaghetti and Meatballs and their daily special, which was a Linguini with Shrimp and bites of Lobster. Absolutely heavenly! Nice for a romantic or intimate outing, or for a family affair. Fresh bread was also provided, and it was definitely fresh, with complimentary bruschetta offered to boot!\n\nWhat a lovely experience, definitely consider this for your next Italian outing. Juan was great, the hostess was great and the manager was so friendly and personal!"

I have often eaten at Italian restaurants, but I rarely see a sausage with mushrooms and peppers entree (pictured) being offered on a New York City restaurant menu. I believe it was listed as one of Isle of Capri's specialties. The large portion is served here with a nice tomato sauce and a side dish of green beans and potatoes. The sausage and peppers were delicious, the cost was $28. I have posted pictures of the inside (taken at 3 p.m.), and outside of the restaurant. They do not close between lunch and dinner time periods."

Despite this, I still left a 15% tip, which wasn't worth it. The outrageous one is that my bank statement later showed an extra $20 charge over what I had left. Does that mean I have to pay 30%+? Why?\n\nFor the experience, after a while of placing my order, they told me the many dishes on Specialities I ordered were unavailable (even simple lasagna). None of the staff seemed to understand the menu. I still accepted the replacements politely. It seems that this friendliness was not understood at all. The bread was terrible, but the pasta was okay.\n\nChanging the tip goes against the spirit of American restaurants."
