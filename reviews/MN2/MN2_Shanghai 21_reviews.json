Always worth the wait.\n\nI gave this five stars over a year ago and I stand by that. I take everyone who visits me in NYC to this place for soup dumplings. The Crab meat and pork ones are my favorite. Just a heads up that they're cash only (or Amex) and there is often a wait, especially for parties larger than 2! But I love coming here. Love it. I've lost count of how many times I've been!"

It's not the typical chicken that's used for this dish. They used a much bigger chicken with thicker meat. The traditional soup dumplings with pork was OK but not my type. These dumplings are with thick flour wraps, and I prefer thin skins. I would not come back and I would choose a different shop nearby."

            "text": "Everything was good, but not five star. Service was profesional, friendly, and quick enough. Quality was good. At least the place was clean and we didn’t have any stomach issue the day after. Food was all alright. We ordered soup dumplings, scallion pancake (that didn’t have much scallion), Shanghai fried rice, and Shanghai lo mien. The fried rice was the best among the four. Other patrons were not loud. So that’s a plus. You also don’t hear all the noise from the kitchen. They also offered cash payment that’s less than the credit card one. So overall, it’s more like 4.3/5.0."

They squeezed our lively bunch in like seasoned pros, and what followed was a truly hilarious and delicious experience.\nFirst off, let's talk about the \"non-alcoholic\" part. We discovered this little detail upon arrival, which for a birthday dinner, was... an interesting twist! Imagining a sober toast with sparkling water was pretty amusing, but honestly, the food was so outrageously good, we barely noticed the lack of bubbly.\nAnd what food it was! We gorged ourselves on the most gorgeous, delicious Chinese food I've had in ages. Every dish was a winner, from the perfectly steamed dumplings to the flavourful noodles. And the best part? The bill didn't make our eyes water – it was all incredibly reasonably priced. So if you're looking for a fantastic, funny, and surprisingly sober culinary adventure in NYC, Shanghai 21 is your spot. Just be prepared for a very clear-headed evening!"

The food was phenomenal and loved everything here\n\nFood : We got scallion pancakes, super crunchy and yum, Spring rolls (definitely have had better), soup dumplings and spicy wonton. All were yum!\n\nService : Quick and simple!\n\nAtmosphere : A very family style restaurant! Loved the homely vibes it has"

We were doing a self-guided dumpling tour so ate light here with only pork soup dumplings and pork buns. The soup dumplings were good, but they lacked some flavor. The dough was great though. I would say if the two dishes, preferred the pork buns."

It melts in your mouth and is full of flavor. The sambal they too was excellent. And for the price everything is great. This place is cash only so prepare in advance. This is a place I can see myself showing off to my friends and taking my wife on dates too because it checks all the boxes at least for the items I ordered. I will be back to try more."
