Everyone was very kind while serving us and the Japanese ice cream was uniquely delicious. The fish shaped cone had its own surprised at the very bottom, it was like some sort of custard but it was complimentary to the ice cream. There are a couple of benches for seating while you enjoy your ice cream, it is a small space but doable for about eight people all at once. There is no outside seating available. We would definitely recommend this buisness to anyone who enjoys ice cream because it's unique, delicious and flavorful.  Thank you for your kindness,  we wish you many years of success and hope to be back in town to enjoy more of your ice cream."

Both were very good with Vanilla being my top choice.\n\nService: 5 Stars\nVery friendly upon walking in and super helpful with any questions we had. They were even nice enough to provide samples to a few flavors before we committed to a choice.\n\nAmbiance: 4 Stars\nThe ambiance is a typical ice cream shop. It is a very small location with a few seats but you're not coming here for ambiance. The best seat in the house is actually a step outside on the streets of NYC.

            "text": "Taiyaki NYC offers some of the most unique and delicious Japanese ice cream in the city! The soft serve in the fish-shaped cone is both Instagram-worthy and incredibly tasty. The flavors are rich, and the toppings are a fun, creative touch. However, at $9, it’s a bit on the pricey side for a dessert. While it’s a splurge, the experience is definitely worth it, especially if you’re looking to treat yourself to something special. Just be prepared for the price tag. Overall, a delightful and memorable experience!"

The guy at the cashier gave the vibes that we annoy him with our presence a bit…lol\nThe ice cream was really mid. Not sure why it has such high rating. Would not recommend"

            "text": "I was invited to an event here and I didn’t know what to expect. These ice cream fish cones are too good to be true: delicious and cute! I was overwhelmed with the flavors because I wanted to try them all. The ice cream specialist offered samples to try various soft serve flavors and explained how each tasted. It was a plus to have the staff be knowledgable because certain days you are in the mood for something sweet, tarty or chocolate-y. I ordered the Straight Outta Japan, a matcha and hojicha ice cream swirl, simple yet packed with a bang. I was debating between that one and the  Unicorn Tyaika, but opted for a simpler version. This means I am definitely come back to stay cool for the next coming summer months. I am so happy I chose such the swirl because it was delicious! It wasn’t too sweet at all and the surprise at the end is the read bean as you take the bite out of the fish cone. What a fun combination of matcha, hojicha and red bean. The accruements of rainbow mocha and wafer stick was icing on the cake."
