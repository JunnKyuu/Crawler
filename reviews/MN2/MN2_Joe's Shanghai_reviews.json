However the fried pork entree which we split amongst 6 grown men, was by far the best pork I have eaten. The pork was served with a side of salt and sauce. Mouth watering and fried to perfection. The restaurant is very big and was packed which is always a good sign. I have nothing but amazing things to say. My one suggestion is to ask for a side of chili oil. Not too spicy but just enough kick."

They bring you food and the check – this is extent of their service. But they put 18% gratuity automatically into the bill, which is insulting. Overall – no atmosphere, no service and mediocre food.

While waiting, guests seated after us had their orders taken. Ok, fine. The food was good, or so it seemed. We got pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes and General Tso chicken. The dumplings were the best of all 3, the pancake was slightly overdone and the chicken was on par with neighborhood General Tso's, i.e. just average. My biggest problem with the food came the next day, today, as I write this. Their offerings were unkind to my stomach to say the least. I would avoid if you cannot risk dealing with mild food poisoning the next day."

Porcje są spore więc warto nie zamawiać zbyt dużo, tylko zjeść i domówić coś więcej.\nReasumując będąc na Chinatown polecam odwiedzić."

We ordered 4 orders of crabmeat soup dumplings and some of the soup are even spilled out and the flavor is lacking. Very watery and not good at all. We also the peanut sesame cold noodles and there was a tiny piece of plastic in there but we didn't even bother saying anything. We order their special shrimp in honey glaze sauce, it was okay. It's sad that Joe Shanghai's soup dumplings went down tremendously. Very disappointing."

I miss the gold fish at the entrance, no cleaning the table with tea, many standard seating and no spinning round tables. I used to love it that you are randomly seated with people at a table and sound the hot sauce to each other. Also the location is now on a main road and not in the narrow streets. The more so called clean modern decoration doesn’t work for me. Seems that the crowed also changed and is less Asian. I still recommend it if you love Chinese food that is good for western taste."
