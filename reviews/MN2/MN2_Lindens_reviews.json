The food was nothing special — the steak lacked flavor, and the Beyond Burger was burnt (the server said that was normal).

I went with the Shishito Julep, and it was perfect.\n\nThe food was out of this world. The sausage breakfast sandwich, citrus salad, and summer carrot ravioli were all phenomenal — the ravioli especially was the perfect balance of savory, herby, buttery, silken goodness with that touch of pancetta. And you must try the fresh-baked bread loaf with herb butter… it’s heavenly.\n\nThe vibe here is just as great as the food: farm-to-table freshness, a warm atmosphere, and staff that feel friendly in a way that’s almost familiar, like you’ve known them forever. Can’t wait to come back!"

First of all the service was excellent.  I wish I had caught the name of the gentleman who served our table, but he was phenomenal, attentive, and deeply knowledgeable of the menu.  All the food was very well done.  Simple dishes with very high quality ingredients, executed perfectly.  But a couple absolutely stood out.  The porter house rolls with chived butter, the Hamachi and the crispy chicken paillard were fantastic.  I would argue that the chicken was the best schnitzelled chicken I have had in the US, paper thin, and perfectly fried."

            "text": "A Hidden Gem with Burgers Worth Writing Home About\n\nTucked away in the heart of the city, Linden’s American Restaurant isn’t just another spot trying to slap “gourmet” on its menu — it means it. From the moment you walk in, there’s a cozy yet confident vibe that makes you feel like you’ve discovered something special. But let’s cut to the chase: the food is where Linden’s really shows off.\n\nFirst up: the burger. This isn’t your average patty-on-a-bun situation. We’re talking perfectly seared, juicy beef that’s seasoned like someone in the kitchen really cares. The bun is soft but holds its own, and every topping — from the melty cheese to the tangy house-made sauce — adds something real to the bite. It’s the kind of burger that demands your full attention. And yes, you will find yourself thinking about it later.\n\nNow, let’s talk fries. These golden beauties come out hot, crisp, and salted just right — none of that soggy, over-seasoned nonsense. They’re the kind of fries that dare you not to finish the whole plate before your main even hits the table.\n\nAnd then there’s the steak — tender, flavorful, and cooked to that perfect balance where it practically melts in your mouth. It’s clear Linden’s isn’t cutting corners; everything from the quality of the cut to the way it’s plated shows care and craft.\n\nWhether you’re looking for a casual dinner or showing a friend your new favorite spot, Linden’s hits that sweet spot between comfort and class. Go for the burger, stay for the steak, and don’t even try to skip the fries — trust me."

Orange marmalade sangria was not as much to my taste unfortunately and the flavour was not as rich as I expected. The cheeseburger was very solid. It was perfectly balanced and they added some spicy elements to it too - definitely a very good one. The French fries were good although a bit salty to me. The truffle aioli was great. The portion size was super large! Overall the food was good but it had pretty straightforward taste. So definitely this place serves good basic food but I personally did not find anything special. The staff members were really welcoming and polite."

Though my steak contained gristle, my glass of wine didn't arrive with the meal - i had to get up, find, and corner the waitstaff. The green onions were too tough to cut with a steak knife and splitting the bill was more problematic than it should have been.\n\nDowngrading the service because they charged the whole dinner to one xard, despite us all signing bills for individual amounts, skdting it out after the visit is painful.\n\nUPDATE 1: The restaurant ignored the phone calls from the 1 member of our party tgat was charged the whole bill. Atrocious service. They should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nUPDATE 2: On July 26th I wrote to Gary with details of event and name of customer they'd overcharged without permission on July 26th. He hasn't replied yet. I'm not holding my breath!!!!"

Jasmine was a fun and friendly server, went above and beyond, didn't rush us and was kind enough to provide two cups for the floral fig cocktail/give us good recommendations for dessert.\n\nI also recommend the cauliflower plate if vegetarian, it was crafted well, fun crispy textures from the quinoa and good use of herbs and spices for flavor. It was a memorable restaurant and would love to come visit again."

My colleague really liked his gnocchi which was fluffy and crispy. The green bowl I got was a bit underwhelming with just mixed greens like a full salad. Service was attentive and efficient."

            "text": "TLDR; this is a simple yet fine dine experience, great service and the food is delicious.\n\nLinden’s is a chic and very simple restaurant that is beautifully accentuated by the decoration and wide open spaces. The food service is exceptional and the waiters are very knowledgeable and courteous. After every plate, we were brought new silverware and our table was wiped off. The waiters were very tentative to refill our glasses and would bring us another bottle of water promptly.\n\nThe food service was quick, we didn’t have to wait very long for it to come out nice and hot. We were here twice and ordered the pancakes, the avocado toast, the carrot ravioli, the giardiniera with pita bread, the burgers and the strawberry tart. All was super delicious and the waiters checked on us periodically to make sure that we were satisfied.\n\nIt was our anniversary and Isaiah (the manager) made it very special for my wife and I- the both times we visited! A very well spoken gentleman, made sure to check up on us throughout our visits. Definitely elevated the experience tenfold. We are very grateful for the wonderful service we received from Isaiah, our waiters and Zeury at the front desk. Zeury takes great pictures, loves taking them and she is just the sweetest! My wife loved her. We will definitely be returning in the near future.\n\nAlso, if you leave a note when making a reservation: they read EVERYTHING. This restaurant alone made our NY trip well worth it."

            "text": "We had brunch on a Saturday and we chose to sit outside because the weather was so nice. The service was so good. Our waitress was so friendly and patient (we were with a small child and asked for an umbrella to cover us from the sun). We ordered a few things: salad, pasta, pizza, toast, and açai bowl. All of them were so fresh and delicious. Somehow they just knew how to make good meal with a perfect balance of taste, texture, and temperature. All meals were worth the price. Seemed a bit high at first, but they were just so good. Would definitely recommend this restaurant!"

From the moment I walked in I was warmly greeted by Levi & Andres, I was given an awesome drink suggestion which was the *Bell pepper Sour* 10/10 beautifully crafted. On to my app I had the artichoke/zucchini tempura which was delightful. My Entree was the Sea Bass OMG it was exquisite!! Chefs Kiss 👌🏾. The Menu is Pricey but worth it! I cannot wait to dine in again, customer service was top tier!"

Our favorite dishes include the seasonal ravioli, the shoestring fries with truffle aioli, the half chicken, and the steak. However, every dish we’ve ever tried from Lindens has never disappointed us. Highly recommend if you’re in New York!"

Only downside is my stomach couldn't fit more!  lol\n\nGabby was our primary waitstaff but everyone kept an eye on the refil of beverages and removing empty plates.  I had the Hanger steak, cooked perfectly and the cookies and creme Brule were my favorite items.\n\nWould love to come back and sit at the bar as the vibe there looked a bit more lively than our table eating."

The menu had a lot of seasonal items, so everything was incredibly fresh. I also really appreciated their creative cocktail menu--it was separated into Herbal, Vegetal and Floral, with unexpected combinations and very cool pairings. Highly recommend the Parker Rolls, the Butternut Squash Ravioli, the Hanger Steak and the Oyster Sampler. Everything was DELICIOUS and the staff was really attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and ingredient lists. 10/10 recommend."

The food was absolutely heavenly. We tried the avocado toast and the açaí bowl. They were both delicious with fresh ingredients. My coffee with almond milk was also yum! Would definitely go back for something casual when in the hood. Prices are on the high side. Go!"
