My party was able to snag bar seats quickly without a reservation, but it’s definitely recommended to plan ahead. We all had the black label burger and it was fantastic! There seemed to be a mixup in the kitchen concerning the temperature of all three of our burgers, but they were kind enough to remake them. The fries were perfect and the fresh pickle was a nice addition. I can’t wait to return and try more of the menu!"

My waiter and all of the staff were incredibly welcoming and kind.\n\nI ordered the radicchio salad and steak frites. The salad was great, used the bitterness of the radicchio as an asset to the dish. Leaned into the natural flavor but still kept it bright and light.\n\nThe steak (what I came for) was terribly undercooked. I asked for medium, it would be generous to say it was rare. Incredibly under salted, and the crust was nonexistent. Relied entirely on the béarnaise for any flavor. Fries were cooked well and stayed crispy.\n\nI know everyone recommends the burger, I was just expecting steak frites at an old school, NY French restaurant to be solid as well."

On the day, I realized this was too late for me and arrived around 6pm instead to try my luck and I'm so pleased I did as I managed to get a stool at the bar  instead by waiting for maybe an hour, which wasn't so bad.\n\nThe staff were really nice and professional and the guys behind the bar were super friendly and exceptional at keeping everyone happy and informed how much longer they would need to wait for a place at the bar. Thank you to them especially for making my evening so special.\n\nThe food was incredible. I ordered The Black Label burger after seeing some of the reviews and everything that was said was true. It really is the best burger in NYC. I also had the apple tart for desert which was also very well made and tasty.\n\nI highly recommend going here for dinner but you must reserve a table as early as you can as it get's super busy."

We weren't expecting much as they had nothing online and it was Friday. Luckily, they had a 5:30 available - so definitely give them a call if you plan to swing by.\n\nWe ended up getting there about 20 mins early planning to just wait at the bar. But they were able to seat us immediately.\n\nFor food, we tried to get most of the popular items. Started off with the bone marrow for the app. It was rich but we felt like it was missing something - 3/5 (we also just had a much better bone marrow at quique crudo). For entrees we decided for the lamb pasta and the black label w/ gruyere per the recommendation of the waitress. The pasta was fine if a tad salty, 3/5. The burger was AMAZING and had such a unique taste. The only complaint was the burger was slightly overcooked - 4.75/5 (more of a medium to medium well than medium rare).\n\nFor desserts, we finished with the souffle w/ ice cream and cocounut cake. Either would easily feed two people but we wanted to try both. All of it was delicious and perfect way to end, 4.5/5.\n\nFood came quickly and service was okay (started off well but tapered off towards the end where we had trouble getting the attention of the waitress)."

            "text": "My first time visiting Minetta Tavern, solo dinner reservation on a Friday night. Many sources call their Black Label Burger one of the best burgers in NYC. 10:45p reservation, arrived a couple minutes before, sat 10 min after my reservation. Ordered the Black Label Burger for $38, it came with fries. Only topping on the burger is caramelized onions, with an optional piece of lettuce and one tomato to add on. No cheese. Was very disappointed with this burger for the price, did not live up to the hype. Single patty of meat, pretty small. Aesthetically looks good, taste is definitely lacking. Could have been seasoned more and a bit dry. Had it cooked medium. Fries were nothing to ride home about. I give the burger a 3-4/10. I won’t be having it again, and would recommend you save your money and grab a burger from a local pub instead. Service was exceptional, and I was even offered a complimentary glass of champagne with my meal. 10/10 for service. Atmosphere is good, busy for a Friday night as expected. Dimly lit, loud restaurant. 7-8/10 for atmosphere."

The hostesses were warm and welcoming, even offering me a seat at the bar while I waited for my table, which made the experience feel effortless from the start.\n\nI ordered the steak frites, which was cooked perfectly and full of flavor, with fries that were crisp and golden. For dessert, I tried the crème caramel— rich, and absolutely faultless (but definitely large enough to share!).\n\nA huge thank you to my servers, Tony and Luiz. Both were wonderful, Tony in particular made my first experience here so memorable with his incredible service and care.\n\nEven the doorman was friendly and welcoming, kindly offering to let me wait by him while I called my Uber—such a small gesture that left a big impression.\n\nI’m already looking forward to my next visit!!"

Almost as good as Lugers! We were assigned what felt like a new waitress but she did okay. She forgot a few things but upon review, we weren't charged for it.\nDesert was great too!"

My husband ordered the burger, and I got the filet, and we both enjoyed our meals. We will definitely be back, and I highly recommend both dishes. The drinks were also good. It’s a tight squeeze in there, but I expected that. It can get a little loud when the restaurant is in full swing, but we thoroughly enjoyed our experience and will be back!"

We had the black label burger which was a big, juicy, flavorful burger cooked to perfection. They had a soufflé that you have to order 20 min in advance that was soooo delicious. Very nice old Manhattan restaurant."

Service was excellent. The ambiance is especially charming with the low lights and nyc Italian vintage look. The place was lively too but not too loud - all in all a really great vibe.\n\nWe had the bone marrow (the biggest serving I've ever had), lobster salad (small but yum) and the steak frites. Everything was delicious. Lots of tables were having hamburgers so maybe I'll try that the next time."

Came in for the minetta burger and I thought it was worth the $38 price point. But definitely not a regular every day meal.  Id like to come back and try the steaks as well.\n\nIt is recommended to order without cheese and cooked medium rare 👍"

There was so much on the menu that I’ll have to return to try some other things. I went for the big name tickets and I wasn’t disappointed.\n🍔 The 8.5/10 Black Label Burger was top notch. The onions, patty and bun blended so well. I’d like a little more attention to detail on the bun (either fresher, toasted or  coated in some interesting flavour) it was just quite plain. That would be fine if it t was leaving space for the flavour of the patty or onions but it wasn’t the case. The seasoning of the patty could have been better to really get that 10/10.\n🥩 The 8.5/10 Bone in New York Strip was another strong hit. The fat could have been rendered better and there could have been more flavour from the flame but the cooking of the strip was very good. The best part was the peppercorn coating. Sharp and strong - special!"

There were bar seats available right away, so we would have been fine either way, but having a table made it even better.\n\nOur server Elora was fantastic. She was attentive and made the whole night even more enjoyable. The restaurant goes from quiet to completely full in no time. We started with the onion soup, which was the best we have ever had. The flavors were perfectly balanced, not too salty or too sweet. The endive salad was just as delicious.\n\nFor our main courses, I had the Minetta Burger cooked medium rare, and it was perfect. Juicy and full of flavor. My wife had the filet au poivre, and it was just as great. Cooked perfectly and full of rich flavor. We finished with the chocolate soufflé, which was the perfect way to end the meal.\n\nThe food, service, drinks, and atmosphere were all outstanding. Minetta Tavern absolutely lives up to the hype. We cannot wait to go back."
