I ordered a mocktail which was delicious considering no alcohol was included. The steak frites also didn’t disappoint. Might’ve been the best steak I’ve had in a while. The value for your money was just top tier. I also want to commend them on the anticipatory service I received. They were very prompt which made our experience quite seamless. There was only problem at the end our lunch. They couldn’t find our check for few minutes which is why I deducted a star.

            "text": "Boucherie West Village: Style Over Substance\n\nBoucherie in West Village nails the atmosphere—think Parisian elegance meets New York chic. But when it comes to food and service, the experience was underwhelming, especially for diners with dietary needs.\n\nOur order included the gazpacho, Nicoise salad, steak and eggs, a non-alcoholic wheat beer, and sparkling water. The gazpacho was the standout—cool, bright, and balanced. The Nicoise, while fresh, lacked flair; the tuna was served plain and would have been elevated significantly with a light sear. The steak and eggs were cooked as expected—decent, but nothing you’d go out of your way to rave about.\n\nService was courteous but inattentive. Despite informing them of a gluten allergy, we were served gluten bread. Fries, listed as gluten-free, are cooked in shared oil, which is a clear cross-contamination issue. We requested vegetables in place of the roasted potatoes to avoid this risk, but the swap was forgotten and had to be reminded mid-meal. The server also struggled to provide clear ingredient details without prompting, which is disappointing at this level of dining.\n\nFor a restaurant that presents itself as upscale and polished, Boucherie needs to do more than just look the part. It should deliver thoughtful service, respect dietary needs without reminders, and offer food that feels more intentional than standard.\n\nA beautiful setting can’t carry a meal alone—and here, it shouldn’t have to.\n\n#BoucherieNYC #WestVillageDining #GlutenFreeNYC #FoodieTruths #FrenchFoodFail"

            "text": "From start to finish, our evening at Boucherie West Village was absolutely outstanding. The ambiance strikes the perfect balance between classic Parisian charm and vibrant New York energy — warm lighting, lively atmosphere, and an elegant yet inviting vibe that makes you want to stay all night.\n\nA huge thank you to Jerros, the General Manager, for his incredible hospitality and thoughtful accommodations. He went above and beyond to make sure our experience was exceptional, and it truly showed in every detail of the night.\n\nOur waitress, Aliya, was equally wonderful — gracious, attentive, and genuinely passionate about the menu. Her recommendations were spot on — especially the Filet Mignon and mashed potatoes, which were both cooked to absolute perfection. Every bite melted in our mouths.\n\nThe drinks were top-notch, beautifully crafted, and complemented the meal perfectly. From cocktails to dessert, everything exceeded expectations.\n\nBetween the incredible food, impeccable service, and warm, welcoming atmosphere, Boucherie continues to be one of the best dining experiences in New York City. A sincere thank you to Jerros and Aliya for making our night so memorable — we can’t wait to return!"

Service was excellent, quick, efficient, and genuinely warm from start to finish. The location is perfect, and the atmosphere lively yet elegant, ideal for both a date night or a group dinner.\n\nThe only small drawback is the layout feels a bit cramped, with tables quite close to one another, which slightly affects privacy. Aside from that, everything else was perfect. A solid five-star experience overall-highly recommend!"

My friend had traditional eggs Benedict and I had eggs Norwegian, which is basically eggs Benedict with smoked salmon instead of ham. Honestly, this is the best eggs Benedict I’ve ever had. These people know what they are doing. And those potatoes with the caramelized onions were banging!  Oh my.  The latte was a work of art and was wonderful.  I’ll let the pictures speak for themselves."

Fuimos a celebrar un cumpleaños, nos sentamos afuera , la mesa estaba montada para  el servicio tipo express, pero tenían platos para pan , nos sirvieron el pan , nunca nos dieron paleteros para la mantequilla, tuve que usar el cuchillo y obviamente tenía mantequilla untada para mí servicio de comida ( El mesero nunca dió paletero ni cambio juego de cubiertos ) , ordenamos dos sopas de cebollas ( Fondo de la sopa estaba salado , muy salado, parecía que tenía tiempo  ese fondo , ya que la sentí demasiada asentada y sé cómo preparar una sopa de cebolla ) , terminamos comiendo la sopa ya que el precio en este lugar es muy cariñoso. Los platos fuertes estuvieron pasables . El mesero fue algo atento , digo algo ya que hizo su trabajo pero resulta que estábamos festejando un cumpleaños, le pregunté si había alguna sorpresa para el cumpleaños, ya saben , algún postre de cortesía, algo que hiciera ameno el momento, y sólo nos dijo que no tenían nada para cumpleañeros.. Nos hizo una broma que si quería podía bailarnos , esa broma estuvo demás. Nos ofreció la carta de postres pero para cobro y pensé si tienen postres , cualquier postre puede servir de sorpresa para el cumpleañero, esté decorado o no , simplemente no quisieron ser gentiles, yo soy Chef , analicé cada situación y déjeme decirles que si cumplen años los invito a no ir a comer aquí, no les importará un pepino. Nuestra cuenta fue de casi $300 dimos buena propina , ya que es exigido pero el mesero que nos atendió Turgut , simplemente no hizo más que su trabajo, no estuvo mal pero no fue extraordinario. Pd : No regresaría más !!"

Exceptional. Their steak frites is a must: perfectly cooked, juicy, with crispy fries that pair perfectly. We also loved the coq au vin, rich and tender. And the crème brûlée? A sweet, satisfying finish.\nIn short, it’s a fantastic spot for great food and a warm atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit!"

Totally recommended as a date spot. Better to make reservations as they get very busy..\n\nI would try the rib eye nect time but the standouts was the waygu burger which they can make into a lettuce bun and yum! pretty good fries and steak frits.. I would definitely get the wague carpachio if I were you ;) reference in the picture"
