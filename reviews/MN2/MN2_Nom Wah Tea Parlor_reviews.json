If a restaurant has been open in NYC for a few years, the food is most likely world class. If a restaurant in NYC has been open for decades, the food has to be world class, and the cost of eating there has to be reasonable. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, traveled the world, this has been my experience.\nNom Wah Tea Parlor has the best Cantonese food I have ever eaten (I have not been to China). The kicker is this, wait for it....\nThe prices are very reasonable! What??? World class Cantonese Food, in NYC, full belly for 3 people, under $100. best kept secret on the NYC food scene. Bar none!"

Great pitstop but nothing fancy.\n\nAs to the incident we may or may not have had with service when paying for our meal. I’m not 100% confident but me and my folks have a suspicion one of the servers pocketed $20 when counting our cash (Amex or cash only). Server stepped away turned his back and returned saying we were twenty short. Upon leaving I noticed he pulled more cash from his pocket from behind the bar. again, I’m NOT certain but it feels strange enough for me to bring up. Could’ve been tips? I hope so."

If you do not tip them at least 18% in tip, they will not let you leave and chase after you until you have paid them. Absolute disgrace and disrespectful to the culture."

As the oldest dim sum spot in the city, it carries an old-school charm that instantly transports you back in time the moment you walk in.

Everything else on the menu is consistently good too, making it a reliable go-to whether you’re introducing someone to dim sum or just craving it yourself.\n\nThe mix of history, atmosphere, and unbeatable quality makes Nom Wah an experience every New Yorker (and visitor) should have at least once."

Complessivamente mi è dispiaciuto trovare un servizio poco affabile. Forse non amano i turisti. Non ho capito. O forse è il loro modo di fare. Senza considerare che appena sono entrata, la persona che mi ha accolto mi ha chiesto subito se avrei pagato in contanti. Al che ho risposto che se necessario avrei pagato in contanti, come se fosse una discriminante. Lui ha ripetuto contanti. Il locale è invece letteralmente stupendo, con tocchi vintage originali. Peccato sia tenuto malissimo. Non solo non è stata fatta alcuna opera di conservazione, ma c’è tanta incuria e sembra tutto appiccicaticcio. Il bagno no comment. I prezzi sono contenuti."

We ordered the og eggroll, which was unlike any eggroll I have had before. Basically a crepe filled with fresh veggies dipped and flour and fried. I enjoyed it. Then we got the soup dumpling which were on the line of trader joes frozen ones and the pork and shrimp shumai which were pretty tasty. Prices were decent. I gave a 25 percent tip and the waitress didnt seem happy about it????? I would recommend the place if u want to experience a 3rd world country feeling walking there.
