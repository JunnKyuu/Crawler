Great sichuan food - the cold appetizers weren’t that spicy but were very flavorful (would prioritize over the hot appetizers). We really liked the soups, very classic chinese taste and big portions for sharing. I’d recommend the west lake beef soup. All of the entrees were chef’s kiss - i really enjoyed the seafood. I think the tell of a good restaurant is how well they cook their vegetable dishes. The cabbage and cauliflower were so flavor - not too oily, perfectly spicy, huge portions. Highly recommend if you’ve been looking for an above par chinese restaurant with authentic flavors!"

Sauteed Snow pea leaves was terrific! Duck with bun is good. The oily dish is my Chinese friend idea. She just wants to show us the food that is common for Sichuan people. I don't really like it because it is too much oil. Lamb with dried chili is okay, a bit too much chilly and salty.

Friendly, prompt service, food was delivered on time. Very good lunch specials suitable for local college students! Dragon Palace - It is a very genuine Cantonese place right in the heart of town 🏙️. The har gow was perfectly crafted and tasted just as good as at the Dim Sum Palace 🥟. We passed by to have a quick dinner before going to a concert 🎶. We were seated within 10 minutes, and food even came quicker. The flavors just threw me back into the dishes of my childhood 🥢.We ordered shrimp har gow, stir-fried bok choy, and beef with broccoli 🥦. Literally, these shrimp har gow were from the gods 👼. Thin yet strong skin wrapped around the juicy filling of shrimp inside perfectly. Rich flavor and on-point texture made every bite a delight 😋. My only regret was that I didn't get more of it. The beef with broccoli had this really great savory flavor with tender beef. It really went well with the steamed rice, and I just scraped the plate clean 🍚. The stir-fried bok choy tasted deliciously garlicky in texture 🧄.Overall, I am quite pleased with the meal I had at Dragon Palace and would greatly recommend this to the Chinese food lovers in the vicinity 🥡."

            "text": "i ordered their sichuan spicy dumpling, hot and sour soup, sautéed garlic bok choi, and crispy chicken (chicken cubes stir fried with red chili pepper). each dish was prepared well and had authentic flavor profiles. the dumplings had a silky soft skin with a well balanced ratio stuffing. they’re also sweet with a slight kick (not spicy). the chicken dish was cooked very well. the meat was crispy on the outside but had an extremely juicy and tender texture inside. the dish packed some heat but i personally love spice so it didn’t bother me. they have many other dishes i’d love to come back again to try (dry pot, braised beef silken tofu, salt and pepper shrimp, etc). highly recommend for some spicy szechuan cuisine!"

            "text": "Well done, Chow House, well done. Authentic cuisine, expertly prepared.  Twice Cooked pork, done the right way. You can see the leeks from the photo with none of that Americanized garbage many places dump into this otherwise elegant dish.  It could have used a touch more spice, I’d ask for it spicier if that’s the way you like it. The spicy crispy shrimp was spicy, whew, that was awesome. Big shrimp.  Big flavor.  Peanuts.  Initially, I was scared of the deep fried dried red pepper, but they turned out really tasty and crunchy, not as spicy as I had originally feared. Pork fried rice, expertly cooked.  All in all, if you live downtown and like authentic Sichuan food, this is your place.  Bravo!"
