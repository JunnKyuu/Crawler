Restaurant seemed busy at the time and service was very rushed, needs improvement for sure."

Overall left feeling very underwhelmed by a place that had strong potential."

Anyways, the food is med to begin with, not bad, but nothing impressive, neither. What really bothered me was the service. The waitresses were close to non-existent and we waited nearly 20 minutes for them to finish chatting at a restaurant corner to resume to their work and give us the check, and I noticed other customers had a hard time getting their attention, too. They also acted rough when serving food/water — everything was almost dumped on our table. I was also very surprised that they did not provide at least a small bowl and spoon for eating soup dumplings, which is a standard practice for soup dumpling restaurants (they only provided a large, round, and flat plate, which was not ideal for most Asian food)."

I liked the Chicken Soup Dumplings, but wish it had more soup inside. The Steamed Pork Buns were steamed really well and had lots of filling inside.\n\nThe Stewed Tofu W. Minced Crab Meats was silky and paired well with white rice on the side. For a veggie dish, definitely get the Stir Fried String Bean W. Minced Pork. I also tried their hearty Braised Beef Noodle Soup and for dessert, got the Crispy Fried Milk."

The “Little Oil Eel Threads” was a standout—crispy, flavorful, and fishy-free. The Squirrel-Shaped Mandarin Fish, with its sweet-savory sauce, was perfect for sweet-toothed diners. The Shanghai Greens were tender and rich, cooked with a high-broth-like depth.\n\nThe menu offers diverse, authentic dishes at reasonable prices. I avoided spicy Sichuan options, but my friends loved them. The open bar adds a lively vibe, and the staff is friendly and attentive. Despite the small space, every dish impressed. Conveniently near a subway and NYU, it’s a must-visit for quality Chinese food in Manhattan. Can’t wait to return!"

To top it all off, closing the meal with **Egg Milk Rice** was the perfect way to go—comforting, creamy, and satisfying. The balance of flavors throughout the meal was simply outstanding.

The mains brought the heat with crispy and tender General Tso Chicken, and a flavor-packed Spicy Fried Chicken in Chili my favorite. We also tried the Kung Pao chicken which was ok. But the real star was the Black Truffle Fried Rice — rich, aromatic, and completely addictive. The vibe is trendy yet cozy, making it perfect for group hangs or a dim sum date night in NYC.

The black truffle fried rice was flavorful and well-executed, and the lychee shrimp balls were creative and refreshing. Definitely some thoughtful touches on the menu.\n\nHowever, the dining experience was seriously let down by the service and environment. We visited on a very cold and windy day, and were seated right by the entrance — which unfortunately had a broken door. Staff were attempting to fix the door during service, but it kept swinging open, letting freezing wind blast into the restaurant.\n\nOur food got cold almost immediately, and the entire meal was uncomfortably chilly. After dinner, I ended up with a really bad stomach ache, which honestly ruined the night.\n\nIt’s a shame because the kitchen clearly puts effort into the food, but the lack of consideration for customer comfort and poor service left a bad impression. I’d only consider coming back if the space and hospitality improve."

This gorgeous lychee shrimp tree here reimagines familiar flavors with so much creativity. The lychee paste mixed with cheese gave a savory note. Super fun and oddly satisfying) to pluck the lychees off the tree.\n\n＊Porcini Mushroom Beef Rice 石鍋牛肝菌拌飯 $27.99**\nIt came in a sizzling hot stone pot that kept it warm the entire meal. It was saucy, with a meaty flavor from the porcini mushrooms and a kick from the green pepper. The portion was huge and easily enough to feed four.\n\n＊Sweet and Sour Ribs 糖醋排骨 $24.99**\nWe were asked to try their sweet and sour ribs, and it ended up being my favorite dish. I usually don’t enjoy eating around bones, but these were braised so tender they fell off easily. Very saucy and savory, perfect with white rice or their porcini mushroom rice.\n\n＊Golden Black Phoenix Bun 黑金流沙包 $9.99\nFluffy bun with the satisfying moment when the salted egg yolk lava oozed out. I just wish there was a bit more filling at this price point.\n\n＊Crab Roe Mixed Noodle 蟹黃拌麵 $18.99\nThe noodles were drenched in a vibrant orange pool of crab roe and shrimp. Visually promising yet flavor-wise, the crab roe was faint. We were reminded to mix everything quickly, or the noodles would stick together.\n\n＊Crispy Fried Milk 炸鮮奶 $10.99\nCreamy milk custard in a light fried batter, served alongside condensed milk. A not-too-sweet sweet treat to wrap up the feast.\n\n＊Strawberry Probiotic Bliss $9.50\n＊Peach Oolong Elixir $9.50\nTheir non-alcoholic drinks were surprisingly good, comparable to the quality you could get at a boba spot."

            "text": "I feel so sorry to have taken my friend here. Honestly I wasn’t happy with a single dish we ordered. They were not authentic at all. Because the ingredients were not good, the bamboo shoot soup had no flavor at all. We even found some sand-like substance in the mushroom beef rice. And the braised pork belly was definitely not freshly cooked. And from time to time I saw flies around.\nOverall it was a terrible experience eating here."

            "text": "I had the pleasure of dining here recently, and the experience was fantastic. The food was bursting with authentic flavors, especially the spicy soup, which had the perfect balance of heat and savory goodness. The stir-fried dish with a mix of fresh veggies and tender meat was also cooked to perfection, with every bite packed with rich and satisfying taste. The presentation of the dishes, as seen in the photos, was appealing, making the meal even more enjoyable.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant felt cozy and welcoming, complemented by friendly service. Everything, from the attention to detail in the decor to the vibrant food, made this a top-notch dining experience. Whether you’re a fan of bold flavors or more subtle dishes, there’s something here for everyone.\n\nHighly recommend this place for anyone craving delicious Chinese cuisine in a relaxed yet stylish setting!"

I love how they incorporated traditional Chinese hard liquor into their cocktail menu and made them delicious. And did you see how cute the glasses are?? Food was also great. Soup dumplings were among the best in the city. There were also many classic Shanghainess dishes.  As someone originally from there, some of the dishes could be a tad sweeter, but they were just right for my  friends 😂😂. Will definitely go back."

The pork dumplings with spicy sauce were yummy, the ma po tofu, made vegetarian was spicy and good. We had the shredded potatoes, which were very delicious. The hot and sour soup was good as well. They have free flavorful peanuts on yoyr table, great but be aware they are not vegetarian. We recommend Yum Cha!"

            "text": "Ambiance (5/5): The restraurant is very nicely decorated with a clean, modern spin Asian decor. There’s intimiate dining spots with private nooks which could be nice for larger parties. Sections of the dining area have booth seating around the inner side. There’s also a full bar with bar seating too.  The inside was darkly lit with a small table lamp for ambiance lighting.\nService (5/5): We were seated immediately on a Saturday night for our party of 2 around 530pm and there was plenty of seating. Whenever we needed service, it was easy to flag down the staff.\nTable seasonings were provided which included 3 sauces including a soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil. Loved the chili oil!\nPork soup dumplings (2/5): Very meh as it tasted like the dumplings could have been frozen instead of fresh, indicated by the bite of the inner meat which was more clumped than loose. But the broth was not super flavorful.\nDan Dan noodles (5/5): The portion was small but the flavor was very rich of a nutty flavor, creamy, and spicy. I loved this dish!\nSzechuan style diced chicken w chili (2/5): There was way too much breading to the small chunks of chicken. I was eating more of the breading than chicken. The spice level is pretty mild despite all the chili that might make it look spicier. The meal does not come with any side of rice but the dish was not too salty or spicy that it required it (good thing!) The flavor was great though."

Of course, there remain gaps from the authentic cuisine that you would have back in China, but this is probably the best you can have. This is place is also clean without worrying too much about sanitation or safety issues you may have in restaurants in Flushing. We have tried : shredded lettuce salad, mandarin fish with sweat sour sauce, shredded eel, salted egg pumpkin, and all of them met my expectations."

Some excuse about something wasn’t turned on. The dishes were not cold but lukewarm warm and obvious pre cooked.\n\nI was so embarrassed because I was taking a client out for the New Year, sadly I picked the place from its reviews. Next time he said, he will take me to a better place to celebrate lunar New Year. Luckily, I ran into friends who also were going to try the food here but my friend gave them a better suggestion. Even cold the rib dish tasted ok."

Had broccoli with garlic, stir fried beef with cilantro and peppers, pork dumplings, and our favorite, cabbage with chilis. The prosecco was also excellent. Highly recommend!"
