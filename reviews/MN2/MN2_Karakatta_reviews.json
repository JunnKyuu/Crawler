It brings back the cozy, homemade feeling of something my grandma would’ve made—hearty, rich, and full of soul.\nThe staff are always warm and welcoming, making us feel like true regulars. It’s more than dinner—it’s our weekly ritual."

The broth was rich and flavorful, and the noodles tasted handmade (I think!). Everything was spot-on. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed, and our food came out quickly. The only downside is that the space is quite small, so it might feel cramped if it’s busy. Luckily, we were there at a quieter time. I highly recommend this place—it’s truly fantastic!"

The ramen price point can be just a bit high but you won’t be disappointed while you indulge in a bowl of their ramen. Be mindful of the soup base you get they are different in texture and thickness. I recommend the pork broth which sits perfect with their scallions, noodles, egg and protein option."

To drink, we ordered Ramune (a very smooth and delicious Japanese soda) and we also ordered a Japanese cocktail that I don't remember the name of but it had something similar to jelly, it was very sweet and mild but we enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\nThe girl from the staff who served us was very friendly, she gave us very good suggestions regarding food and drinks and was attentive to everything.\n\nSomething important, we went with our cat and she was allowed as long as she was obedient (we had her inside the briefcase), there was no problem for our baby.\n\nSo if you want a cozy experience and to enjoy japanese food, this is the place."

However, the broth is a bit over seasoned so I didn't taste much of the meaty flavor. The Butter Miso Ramen is as expected, with just-enough-buttery broth. Both bowls have pork belly, which are a bit overcooked in my opinion.\n\nI would be hesitant to come back out of my way, but certainly with friends for a quick meal."

            "text": "Karakatta is near the Washington Square park in NYC. We heard a lot of good reviews about this place from our friends. The place is extremely small with about 8 tables for 2 but the ramen is very good. We started with the Karrage Chicken (which is almost our staple at any ramen place ) which was delicious and a ramen with Chicken broth & protein. The food thing about this place is that you can specify the spice level with all the ramen being at spice level 1. But surely worth a try when near the Washington Square Park."

However, once I finished my noodles, the curry itself became a bit boring, and I couldn’t finish it.\n\nThey have limited space so you might end up sitting in cramped up bar like seats instead of a table. Overall, it’s a great spot for a quick but satisfying meal!"
