Unfortunately, the service was quite slow — our starters took a while to arrive, and the main courses came much later.\n\nThe starters were excellent and highly recommended, but the mains were disappointing. There were three of us, and none of us could finish (or really enjoy) our main dishes.\n\nThe restaurant was also very noisy, which made it hard to have a conversation. The staff were friendly but extremely busy, so it often took a long time to get our server’s attention.\n\nOverall, a mixed experience — great starters, but the mains and service really fell short."

The restaurant was fairly empty so I was surprised when we were told we could be seated but that we needed to leave by 6 because of upcoming reservations. We should have left at that point. We were seated and ordered drinks, focaccia, and pasta. As we were eating at no point was more than 1/3 of the restaurant full. Just made me feel anxious the whole time we were eating that we’d stay longer than 6 and then what would have happened? Good was okay, not great. Our sever changed half way through our meal which was okay but odd. Overall, for the price of the food and drinks, I’d go somewhere else next time."

When we first arrived for our 7pm reservation, we were asked to wait by the bar for our table to be ready, which was perfectly fine. We enjoyed dinner and had just gotten the drinks we ordered for dessert when we were asked to take our drinks back to the bar to finish because they needed the table. So at 8:30 on the dot, we were removed from our table and stood at the bar to finish our drinks. I know that most reservations include a 90min disclaimer but I have genuinely never had this happen to me before. I understand the restaurant needs to turn tables but I felt it was a bit extreme to remove us at exactly 90mins after our reservation and when we had just received our last drinks. It felt like we were no longer welcome and will not be coming back."

The place was poppin w large groups of women celebrating. Given how many people were in a large space, the acoustics were surprisingly great. We could hear each other and not yell across the table.\n\nThe service was absolutely excellent. We ordered a drink at the wine bar when our server came over to seat us. They had the drinks promptly delivered to our table and we didn’t even have to say anything. Felt really nice to be so taken care of!\n\nI got the rigatoni and it just wasn’t great. The chicken Milanese was on the thicker side. The ricotta and eggplant were excellent.\n\nI would absolutely go back though. Great holiday vibes and the staff works so hard!\n\nUpdates - took a f friend here over Labor Day weekend and the food was absolutely incredible. The steak, potatoes, whipped ricotta on focaccia w truffles and honey, absolutely mind blowing. Already planning my next visit!"

            "text": "My three friends and I traveled to New York for a much awaited trip and unfortunately Rosemarys cast an awful shadow on our time in New York. From the moment we entered, the two hostesses on the door were very standoffish and rude. One hostess in a very rude and disrespectful tone said that my friend had her name spelled incorrectly on the booking - this is simply my friends Irish name. As we were sat down, there was a very strong hostile vibe coming from the servers. Putting this aside, we decided to focus on enjoying our meal and drinks. However, when we ordered our drinks, and asked for ID one of my friends was told her ID wasn’t valid. Given we traveled transatlantic, we did not carry our physical passport books out with us, just our identity cards from our respective countries. Whilst two of our cards were accepted, my other friends was not. Kevin our server, was kind enough to check with his manager if this was valid. However, the manager came to our table with honestly the most rudest and patronising explanation. Given the ID can be used as a valid method of travel, we queried this but where then very rudely mansplained the concept of a passport. As three people who have all worked in the hospitality and service industry, we know the stress and intensity of restaurant work but the way we were spoken to was unacceptable. As a quiet, non rowdy group of young woman we were extremely embarrassed and upset in how we were spoken to. Two of us got our drinks, and when we all got our food, we felt that the hostess was circling our table and it was all around uncomfortable. A gorgeous restaurant with decent food, but the staff need some serious thinking about how they approach and communicate with guests - when you give respect you get respect. We understand that the ID requirement is a policy but given this, it should be specified in the booking: All around upsetting."

Well while i waited forever to be attended to within my 1.5hrs i found  a nasty bug hiding out in my napkin. The food was lacking in flavor. Believe the Yelp reviews. The salad was not fresh at all and tasteless. The entree was a waste of time severely lacking in seasoning.  Management needs to realize that service is subpar at this establishment. You had all these workers milling around this horribly noisy place dragging chairs and slamming dishes on the table, yet they all manage not to see you trying to get their attention smh. Also, please get rid of this sheisty, sneaky way of shoving those payment machines in our faces with tips starting from 20% on sometimes the total, not the subtotal as it should be. It's tacky and shows less than honest business practices. These machines have been used all over Europe since the 2000s but trust Americans to abuse the purpose of a thing. Now that the restaurants got their greasy hands on it, they use it as a tactic to extort tips out of patrons. I will gladly tip for even half decent service, but for subpar service combined with tasteless unseasoned food, it leaves a bad taste."

But she was not, an hour later she was still serving , just not our table but literally the table two tables over. ODD!\n\nThe food is fine, nothing to write home about. I did not think the dishes ordered were anymore impressive than any other Italian restaurant of its calibar.\n\nIt was evident that my party of 2 had severely overstayed our time limit, after 45 minutes of receiving our dinner, almost immediately various staff kept coming over asking are we done? Can we box this up for you? Do you need anything else? About 6 different staff not including our new server kept coming to the table which I now understand, was to encourage us to GET OUT!\n\nFinally, a manager came over and (politely) asked could we move to the bar as they had other reservations and needed the table. AWKWARD!\n\nA rationale person can deduce with the number of staff that kept coming to the table and finally a manager, coming over, clearly they all were talking about us, agitated, and wanted us to leave. And we immediately left thereafter.\n\nFriday night, west village, I get it. But this is not the place for date night or conversation.\n\nI highly encourage you to eat your food within a one hour period or less and immediately leave.\n\nI am very confident in my review and my experience. I have no qualms if someone has concerns with my review."

I ordered the ‘Steak Tagliata’ and ‘Rosemary Potatoes.’ The steak was just okay, and the sauce had anchovies in it, which I didn’t enjoy that much. I’m a steak lover but something was off. The potatoes were good. I would definitely go back, but I’d order something else."

The cheesy foccacia was also so good. Service was excellent, I think our server was Myra and she was really helpful and made great recommendations. Price was pretty reasonable too for such a nice place. Would definitely go again."

            "text": "It was a truly wonderful experience. My friend and I enjoyed a market salad first, and we believe that to truly judge the quality of a restaurant, their salad is the critical place to start, and they nailed it. The greens were so flavorful and fresh they could have been served without dressing but the light vinaigrette was just perfectly balanced and elevated what was already a delicious dish.\n\nThen there was the sandwich. I have worked in delis, and have scoured New Yorks sandwich scene and was shocked to find that the Italiano Panino at Rosemary’s may be in my top 3… and it’s a full service restaurant!!!"

But the vibe of the cool farmhouse-chic open space, very nice staff and great-looking menu is gonna bring us back again soon.  Go!"

The waiter gave me more bread after which is when I realized the first bread given were much drier.\nI ordered the olives, the eggplant appetizer and an aperol spritz.\n• The marinated olives is embedded in a mixture of cumin and olive oil. Amazing flavors, great with the table bread!\n• Eggplant was flavorful, with pungent tomatoes and soft focaccia.\n• Aperol Spritz was perfect to taste!"

            "text": "Rosemary's is a wonderful dining spot that truly exceeded our expectations. From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The rustic decor and lush greenery create a cozy and delightful setting that immediately puts you at ease.\n\nThe service was impeccable – friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. We started with the beet and goat cheese salad, which was fresh, vibrant, and beautifully presented. The fennel dish was another standout, with a perfect balance of flavors and textures. The smoked salmon with focaccia was simply delightful, with the salmon being fresh and the focaccia crisp and flavorful. The omelet was perfectly cooked and came with a side of fresh arugula, which added a nice, light touch to the meal.\n\nAlthough we didn't have any alcohol, the extensive selection of wines and cocktails on the menu looked impressive. Each dish was a testament to the farm-to-table approach that Rosemary's prides itself on, with high-quality, fresh ingredients shining through in every bite.\n\nOverall, our dining experience at Rosemary's was exceptional. We left thoroughly satisfied and eager to return for another delightful meal. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy top-tier cuisine in a charming and comfortable setting!"

Apparently a lot of their herbs and produce come from their rooftop garden!\n\nAll of our food was super tasty and fresh. My favorite was the whipped burrata!"

            "text": "Rosemary’s was fantastic. The atmosphere was so warm and inviting (especially around Christmas time). We missed our reservation grace period by 2 minutes due to some subway issues so we had to wait some extra time but they got us seated quickly.\nWe started with the cacio e Pepe polenta and it was to die for, the whipped burrata was fantastic too, no notes. We also got a Caesar salad which I loved but it does come with whole anchovies on it and my friends were not a fan so I ate them all haha.\nWe each got a different pasta dish including the shrimp linguine, bolognese, carbonara, and Orecchiette. All of the pasta dishes were ahhhmazing. If you like garlic, the linguine is for you. If you like a hearty meat sauce, get that bolognese. The carbonara was creamy and perfectly salty. And the orecchiette was chefs kiss 👌🏼\nAll in all we had a great experience! Thank you!!"

Apparently I was told that they grow their own herbs on the rooftop. It’s a wonderful place to dine- cozy, could be romantic or even family friendly. I absolutely love the place and will be back."

The portion of the food is just right. Their Chocolate Torta is a must order if you ever come here. Food was fresh. The atmosphere feels lively, and good service.  We ordered Calamari Fritti, Chitarra Alla Carbonara, Bolognese pasta, and chocolate Torta. I have to say that I'm a big pasta lover and this place did not disappoint at order if you go. The vibes inside felt cozy with Christmas music playing. There's also a tree inside where people can take pictures. It's a great spot for casual dining and enjoying the neighborhood vibe here. I'll definitely come back again for their delicious pasta."

Our server was a little bit clumsy this year, but nothing major to complain about. The food has been consistently tasty.\n\nWe had the steak for the first time this visit. It was tender and of a high quality considering it’s a fairly affordable price for a steak. The rigatoni alla arrabbiata was simple and spicy. A little too al dente for my preference. Nevertheless, I was still pleased with it.\n\nI look forward to returning next thanksgiving eve!"

Unfortunately our server was mainly transactional (ready for drink? Ready for order? Ready for dessert? Ready for bill? Etc.)\n\nThe Rosemary’s Prosecco was refreshing and sweet. The meatballs were one of the best we’ve had in NYC - moist and soft, intense flavors from the beef, pork and prosciutto. Another unfortunate miss … the meat balls were not served hot, almost as if from leftover at another table.\n\nThe linguine was also not well presented - just a blob of pasta tossed with small shrimps. No garnish. A bit flavorless except the garlic.\n\nThe special salad with kales, pumpkins, quinoa was exceptional. A true autumn salad. The presentation again not visual pleasing.\n\nOther dishes we had were good. We had a very good time. Will definitely come back to visit the garden upstairs."

The orechiette particularly was a bit unedible, very overwhelming. The bombolini dessert was good but the nutella cream did not really add anything to it. Sadly won’t be coming back, despite the nice servers and cozy interior."
