Absolutely wonderful, absolutely must visit for everyone who wants to try the best (imho) Italian food in nyc and no doubt get the best wine options.\nIm so happy we decided to try different meals, and from the very first bite of focaccia we enjoyed everything.

I came in with high hopes after hearing great things on social media, but was disappointed by the overall quality. It felt like you’re mostly paying for the ambiance rather than the food itself. That said, the service was efficient and the dishes came out quickly, which I did appreciate. Unfortunately, I don’t think I’d return."

This restaurant is a true destination.\n\nThe design and decor are super charming—it feels like stepping into a sun-drenched Italian villa. We were lucky enough to dine in their outdoor covered patio space, and I highly recommend it. It was incredibly romantic and intimate, perfect for a special meal with my partner.\n\nWe started by sharing the delectable tomato tart along with the radicchio and fig salad. Both were light, fresh, and beautifully executed, proving that even the simplest dishes here are crafted with care.\n\nFor our main courses, the kitchen really shined:\n* My partner’s Chicken Milanese was perfectly cooked—crispy on the outside, and wonderfully moist and juicy inside.\n* My fresh cod was divine! It was served atop a rich hazelnut cream sauce and complemented by fresh, earthy chanterelle mushrooms.\n\nEvery bite, from start to finish, was pure joy. Adding to the wonderful atmosphere was the welcoming and friendly hospitality of the staff, which made us feel completely at home.\n\nWe loved our experience so much that we are already planning a return trip before we leave the city! We can’t recommend Palma enough for a delicious and memorable dining experience."

The level of service and hospitality was simply unmatched — warm, attentive, and genuinely passionate.\nAndy and Guillaume took exceptional care of us throughout the evening.\n\nTheir professionalism, charm, and deep knowledge of the menu elevated our entire experience. It’s rare to feel so well looked after, and they truly made us feel like honored guests.\n\nEverything we ordered — from the drinks to the appetizers, entrees, and desserts — was nothing short of exquisite. Each dish was perfectly balanced, beautifully presented, and bursting with flavor.\n\nAnd the tiramisu… where do I even begin? Hands down the best I’ve ever had — possibly the best on the planet. Creamy, rich, and flawlessly executed — it was the perfect finale to an already unforgettable meal."

The service was okay.. not stellar, but there are better meals to be had in NYC."

On top of that, it felt like my pasta was missing a sauce—I never asked for it to be left out.\n\nWhen I asked what their signature pasta was, the waiter just said people order something different every time—which was not exactly reassuring.\n\nAs a walk-in guest, I was annoyed right from the entrance when a lady pushed for unnecessary personal details. That level of aggressiveness completely disappeared by the time I left—no goodbye, nothing.\n\nOverall, the food and service don’t justify the price. Totally overrated. I still left a tip, but honestly, it felt like a waste."

This restaurant came up as having great gluten-free options when I was doing some research for a dinner with some friends. It's rare to find a restaurant that is good at gluten-free pasta but according to my GF friend, the Cacio e Pepe ravioli was amazing.\n\nThe quality of the ingredients is so clear as you are eating the food and after. I went with the Paccheri all'Astice: the pasta was perfectly al dente and there was a generous amount of lobster which was also cooked to perfection. The sauce is simple yet flavorful and it's everything you could ever want in a seafood pasta.\n\nOur server Guillaume was so kind and attentive and we were really treated so well throughout the whole evening. I would wholeheartedly recommend this place to all pasta lovers and especially to those with GF diets!"

However, the portion sizes did not meet our expectations given the pricing, and we couldn’t help but comment on it throughout half the meal, ultimately leaving hungry and searching for another place to eat right after.\n\nVisiting from New Jersey, we’re familiar with NYC pricing, so that wasn’t the issue. But when we ordered the $34 tortellini, we didn’t expect just about 10 dime-sized pieces. The $39 chicken Milanese came as a single thin cutlet, it was gone in under five minutes, barely enough for one of us, let alone sharing.\n\nTo add to the disappointment, I found myself repeatedly seasoning the dishes with extra salt and pepper. For a $150+ meal, I didn’t expect to be doing touch-ups at the table.\n\nIf you’re looking for a charming, intimate setting, Palma certainly delivers on ambiance — just be prepared to make a second stop afterwards or cook at home to feel truly satisfied."

The food is incredible + the cocktails are so delicious (their mezcal-based option is my favorite). Try their Arancini, Insulate dell 'Orto, and warm Focaccia to start. For primi, definitely sample their Ravioli Cacio e Pepe & Agnolotti agile Spinaci (everything is SO yummy). For dessert, spring for the gelato (the olive oil flavor is insanely good, as is their pistachio flavor). The cheesecake is light and isn't too sweet - it's wonderful. Also of note, the staff here are so kind & accommodating (shout-out to Hannah & Nick) and the vibes inside Palma are immaculate. You're surrounded by fresh flowers everywhere you go!! I cannot recommend this place enough!! It’s my favorite spot in the West Village."

But it ended up being just okay… a bit over-fried and pretty average in flavor.\n\nThe duck pasta was also a letdown—too salty, and the duck didn’t taste very fresh. Then we had the lamb chops, which were under-seasoned, though the pumpkin puree underneath was surprisingly delicious.\n\nThe real stars of the meal were actually the seafood dishes. The fried calamari and the salad were so good—totally blew me away. If you come here, don’t miss the seafood. That’s where they shine.\n\nOne thing I really appreciated was the flowers—every single one of them is real, no fakes. You can tell the owner really puts love into this place. The floral arrangements were absolutely beautiful, and I couldn’t help but take a bunch of pictures.\n\nMy friends loved the decor too—it’s such a photogenic spot, especially for girls. If your girlfriend or bestie has a birthday coming up, this place would definitely make her smile. The interior design is just stunning."

But I haven’t found a restaurant that has incredible food with incredible atmosphere that take you of New York and feel like you are in Florence or Venice. Palma. Is it. The lobster spaghetti is out of this world. I will be going back to this spot a lot. 5/5."

Food was great and the service was really good, which made our  ladies gathering so enjoyable. The tiramisu, tortellini in chicken broth and fritto misto were my favourites.  Portions were appropriate.  2 appetisers. 3 pastas and 3 desserts are enough for 4 asian females’ stomachs. Menu also suitable for vegetarians."

My partner got gluten free pasta and I was SHOCKED at how amazing it was. The flavors were incredible. Such a wonderful experience and we’ll definitely be back."

It feels like you’re in a small town in Italy. At first they sat us at a small table and we asked if we could get a larger one since we felt a little squished. The manager was so kind and moved us immediately despite them being very busy. The manager of the restaurant is an absolute delight! She was very personable, kind and made our night so enjoyable. Our waitress was also very attentive and made sure we were enjoying everything. The food was delicious and fresh. We can’t wait to come back next time we are in town. Ciao!"

Ive eaten at John besh restaurants, Emeril lagasse restaurants, and the best Italian food Louisiana has to offer.\n\nYou can taste everything in the dishes. The calamari tasted like the first thing fried in fresh oil in a brand new fryer.\n\nThe fried risotto I've had in Louisiana. It was unlike anything at palmas. Palmas were dusted with such a delicious Parm and parsley. The red sauce came through and made its own taste statement. We were moaning and wowing through our entire appetizer experience.\n\nThe Bolognese was flavorful, salted correctly, and the pasta was perfection.\n\nLastly had the tiramisu for desert and it was smooth cold light and subtle with all the dark flavors.\n\nWe felt at home under the courtyard lights. The staff was great, the atmosphere was beautiful. Palma has done such a wonderful job with the roses and we couldn't have been happier to dine here for our last night in NYC. The only sad part of the night was our last bite. Thank you from Phillip in Louisiana. ❤️"

The food, wine, and service was all fantastic. We sat “outside” in the courtyard and it was lovely. It did get quite loud in there - a warning for those hard of hearing. But we loved that as part of the atmosphere. If I ever make it back, I would 100% be booking this restaurant."
