We could have eaten a whole pizza. Great crust!! toppings simple and tasty. Long lines but it moves fast. Lot of people grab and go. They are making the pizzas fresh. Very tasty, very NYC, pop in and get two or 3 slices!"

If you go on a slower day consider ordering a whole pie fresh vs individual slices.  Big difference when it was fresh out in taste and quality."

            "text": "In my Summer 2025 Pizza Top 5 list, Bleecker Street Pizza comes in third place.\n\nBleecker St. Pizza is hyped by several NYC bloggers. I can understand the hype. The slices are very tasty. I had a Margerita (Cheese) a Peperoni with Jelapenos. The crust is a bit too crispy for me and the Mozzarella dominates the slices. The tomato sauce is great. OMG, the jelapenos blew me away - I thought I was used to hot food. I looove the level of spiciness! The ice-cold Coke saved me. The bit too much fat on the pizza can easily be wiped off with napkins. Overall it is a typical NYC pizza with pretty good quality and definitely worth trying.\n\nThe shop has two seating areas inside and one outside on the busy 7th Avenue. It's not exactly charming; there are TV screens everywhere and the rooms are very spartanly furnished. Overall, the shop fits in very well with the neighborhood, on the border of East and West Village, where five of New York's top pizzerias are located.\n\nI guess I was very lucky because on my visit there was no waiting line at all!\n\nI recommend Bleecker St. Pizza."

Between The New Penn Station remodel and Downtown Congestion Pricing tolls, the city actually seemed a bit quieter, roomier and airy. What better time to soak in this change than to have a slice of Sicilian pizza at the BLEEKER STREET PIZZARIA .\nAt $7.91 for both Sicilian square and Ginger Ale I actually had a delicious experience . The slice was crunchy (cheese) chewy and the sauce? Don't even go there!!!!, made it all come together. Ambiance was the locals that walked in. I mean I am technically the outter Towner, right?\nAppointed seating arrangements with a small step flight up to a few more tables with a TV (not needed with the introduction of the cellphone) comfortable.\n\n*NOTE: THIS ESTABLISHMENT DOES NOT HAVE PATRON BATHROOMS* to which I couldn't understand that one?\n\nPizzaria does play music, for me a little loud and in some cases not soothing. You will see framed people pictures on the wall showing its heritage, nice touch. All in all a diamond in the \"Stuff\" like in its fresh food selection.\n\nAvoid driving in \"AKA\" congestion pricing silly... LOL\n\nFrom 34th Street Penn Station take the M20 bus at $2.90 from 7th Avenue 34th Street, get off 7th Avenue Barrow Street. Stops directly across the street from the pizzaria. *Remember to walk on Barrow Street to Hudson Street to catch the M20 back to 34th street. Go check them out and tell them the Guru sent you.\nPS.. Pizzaria had Graffiti above it, I had to photo shop it out. Owner should paint over it🙋\n\nThe Review Guru*\nLong Island NY"

I stood in front of the register wanting to pay and she ignored me and lied about it when staff asked why I'm cancelling as they seemed surprised I did. You order food and the male staff don't even say thank you anymore or will just have you standing in front of them as they clown around and ignore customers. This place is an ego centric mess that will push away customers over time. It already is happening with the quiet afternoons I've seen.\n\nThere are too many wonderful pizza shops in the city to deal with the disrespect and narcissistic behavior.

It’s usually packed with people grabbing a slice to go after a night out in the area. They serve delicious pizza with a clear Sicilian influence. The Nonna Maria is a standout—topped with a rich, homemade tomato sauce that tastes just like a great pasta sauce. We also tried the Sicilian slice, which was another pleasant surprise. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in the neighborhood!"

            "text": "On a corner of Bleecker Street you can visit euphoria if you so choose to. Bleecker Street Pizza is a flavorful punch of a slice, well positioned amongst the hierarchy of New York pizzerias. The inside is unassuming, a lot like a million other places but whatever is going on in that oven is the truth. When we stopped by there was a decent sized line but they do keep it pushing well. Despite the amount of people indoors the place is still pretty clean and there is an order to all the madness going on around you. Lining the walls they have photos of celebrities who made the trek (or swiped a Metrocard) to enjoy a slice here. Like any pizzeria they offer a lot of different slices but since we’ve heard this place was one of the best slices in the city we opted for a regular cheese slice, no frills to make sure we were hearing correctly.\n\nAfter getting our slice and sitting outside (yes, they do have outdoor seating but it is hard to come by), we were ready to dig in. Here’s our careful analysis: the crust is undoubtedly New York style. Firm, crisp, not too much give and not burnt to high heavens like a New Haven slice. A little flop to it but a firm underbelly to the slice, which seems like an over evaluation, but trust that it is not. The first bite was incredible. The cheese is stretchy and light, the sauce rich but complimenting the cheese. Easily one of the 3 best pizza slices in our lives based on the first bite alone and by the final bite we were questioning if it was the best period. Needless to say, Bleecker Street Pizza is not an if you’re in the city or an if you’re in the area excursion; this is a go out of your way and eat this slice place. Phenomenal and trying to find excuses to come back for seconds ASAP."

Located in the heart of the West Village, this small and casual spot serves up thin, crispy, and flavorful pizza that consistently lives up to the hype. The Nonna Maria slice is especially popular and truly delivers — rich tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and a perfect crust. Service is quick, and the atmosphere is no-frills, just like a real NYC pizzeria should be. Whether you’re grabbing a late-night bite or a quick lunch, it’s a solid and satisfying choice."

He talked to us about the restaurants history and his brother, and even gave us a postcard that we can take home with us. If you’re able to make it here any day, you definitely should!! The pizza is soooo good (Greg’s families recipes)!! If you’re able to make it on a Friday, even better! Any time we come back to NY, we will visit this spot. 🩷"

            "text": "Bleecker Street Pizza is a NY classic. Visiting town and stopped in. The guys that run this shop are friendly but they offer few modifications so you either like what’s in the case or head to Joe’s down the street with more options. Personally, I think Bleecker is much better and I don’t think you can go wrong with any of the slices in the case but everyone has a picky friend. There’s plenty of room to stand at the table in the middle or the small side tables inside and out. You might wait a few minutes but pizza is a quick meal so table turnover is fast and the guys are good about wiping them down in between. They also sell white claw and beer for anyone looking for a drink with their slice."

The location is ideal for grabbing a bite while exploring the neighborhood, but what really made our visit special was the hospitality.\n\nGreg was incredibly friendly and made us feel so welcome from the moment we walked in. His warmth and energy gave the place an authentic, inviting vibe that you just don’t find everywhere.\n\nAnd the pizza? Absolutely amazing. Crispy crust, delicious sauce, and fresh toppings — every bite was perfect. We seriously wish we had time to go back for a second visit. Next trip to NYC, this will definitely be a repeat stop!"

We always buy a couple of slices to eat and a couple of pies to take home for the family. Today we had the honor of meeting the owner, Greg. As we enjoyed a slice of their famous Nonna Maria’s pie, we chatted and he told us all about the history of the pizzeria, his family, his brother, Doug, and their grandma Nonna Maria. It was a pleasure and just made this spot even more special to us now. Great NY pizza, great atmosphere, and great service! Will be back the next time we are in NY and highly recommend this pizzeria to others! Thanks again Greg!"

The vibe is always lively inside and staff will ensure the line keeps moving efficiently. Whether it’s the middle of the day or late at night, I always get a hot and crispy slice here. There’s more room inside than you would expect and easy to access all the west village activities."

I highly recommend it. The only thing I didn’t love about it is the environment is a little bit cramped and chaotic but the food and the people and the service are top-notch.  Eating here is totally worth it if your goal is great pizza in NYC in a casual environment. Also, it is priced reasonably."

            "text": "I was trying to find good pizza since John’s of Bleecker’s had a really long line. I didn’t have to go far because this place was right around the corner. There still was a line but it moved fast you can either get a slice which they will warm it up for you, or get a pie which they will make it fresh for you. Let me say they are fast they were getting people in and out and the freshly made pie that I ordered took less than 15 minutes. I got chicken & pepperoni my go to staple. The pizza was a nice size for less than $30 bucks. It had some flop to it, plus claiming it’s the best thin crust pizza. I’d say it’s not really that thin like Dave Portnoy said it’s more of an average crust in new York style pizza. However I’d say it’s better than what Dave gave it but still not the best I’ve had either. It’s still a very good pie up there in my books it’s a must try especially how far they get those pies out excellent customer service. They also had a good amount of seating inside and outside."

The Buffalo chicken pizza was a standout, featuring a bold garlic sauce that added a rich, savory kick—perfectly balanced with the spicy chicken.
