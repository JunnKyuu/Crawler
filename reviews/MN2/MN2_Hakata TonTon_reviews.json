            "text": "It was a wonderful experience, one I’ll never forget. The staff were extremely friendly, to say the least, and the food was out of this world. The mix of Asian and Japanese flavours will blow your tastebuds away to heaven. One of my favourite dishes of the night was the foie gras. The duck liver will melt in your mouth, flavours unstoppably seeping in. It was then combined with outstanding rice and bean curd skin, it fits perfectly. The fusion of taste don’t just add up to each other, they multiply each other and increase the already amazing tastiness. It was so good we had to order another plate. Next came the pork knuckles. We ordered both flavours, the vinegar and the garlic. Both were remarkable, but the garlic one was truly  magnificent. Considering I’m not a huge fan of cilantro, it fitted surprisingly well with the extraordinary texture. The dessert was also exceptional. The cheesecake was a mixture of New York style and Japanese style, a soft crumbly exterior and a gooey interior. It wasn’t too sweet, but hit the spot. This spot is a must try, truly ground breaking. I am amazed and do recommend it for everyone."

The food is beautifully presented & dishes are delicious.  Price is more than reasonable compared to Soho, midtown, or uptown.  Service is also attentive, polite & prompt.  Can’t ask for more these days with the burden of food cost, sales taxes , & 20%+ service charge, eating out is no longer fun & affordable + frequently deal w/ nasty food.  I would like to give this new food establishment 6 STARS."

            "text": "Short review- order the goma, kani, wagyu, tonsoku. Nabe/hot pot is alright.\n\nI went here a while with a group.\n\nThe first thing that arrived was probably my favorite bite of the night which was the Goma Hamachi for $20 with baby yellowtail with scallion, seaweed, and sesame sauce which is poured table side. The hamachi was excellent quality being buttery with a soft texture and the nutty sesame sauce (said goma) worked nicely with it. This was excellent and I would recommend it heavily.\n\nAlso very tasty was the Kani Harumaki for $14 with a blend of snow crab, pork, mushroom, and vegetables served with spring roll skin which came with a light soy based dipping sauce. There was a bit of sweetness, a bit of earthiness, and some richness and it all fit well with the crispy skin. This was very good as well and was decently portioned for the price point.\n\nAlso very tasty was the Wagyu Yakiniku Wrap for $18 with BBQ washu beef with lettuce, pickled vegetables, and mayo wrapped in a scallion pancake. This was perhaps a bit messy due to the mayo as well as the sweet sauce especially when paired with the slightly oily pancake but the flavor was excellent. The beef quality was high and it had some sweetness to it but not too much so and the pickled vegetables added a nice crunch.\n\nThe Tonsoku Ponzu for $13 with grilled pork feet with scallion and ponzu sauce is one of their signatures that you can't really find in many other Japanese spots. The dish of course has a lot of collagen so it's rich and fatty but the ponzu helps cut down the richness of the pork. There was also a Japanese hot sauce on the table which helped as well. This was also good though I would recommend more compared to other small plates to share.\n\nThe Kara Age for $9 consisting of Japanese fried chicken with mala mayo was pretty standard outside of the price point being relatively cheaper for the portion size compared to most other places. The chicken was pretty tender though I have had much crispier versions before but I can't complain with the light batter and the amount of chicken given. Though the color was different, the mayo also didn't exactly have any type of mala seasoning either but it still worked with the chicken.\n\nThe Koji Ebi Chili for $20 consisting of shrimp with sweet chili over egg omelette was pretty standard western Japanese/Yoshoku style comfort food. There was plenty of shrimp/ebi in there and the sweet chili was standard. I wish the egg was a bit fluffier but that is only a minor fault in an otherwise standard tasty dish.\n\nLast was our large main to share which was the Tonton Hotpot (or nabe) which is $68 for the large or $38 for the small and we got the large one which was large and fine. This came with pork feet, chicken thigh, pork belly, dumplings, tofu, vegetables, and your choice of soup where we got the spicy miso tonsoku soup. The primary meat in there was the tonsoku/pork feet with there being some thigh and a little bit of dumplings and pork belly. Outside of the size which is easily big enough for four people as it should be for the price point, it's hard not to compare it unfavorably to some other nabe spots such as Kimura or even some other recent ones such the izakaya Toriya on the LES which both had much better broths, a little more variety in terms of vegetables, and was not focused on one meat in particular. Possibly the motsu/intestine pot is better here but I would recommend sticking with their other dishes instead.\n\nThis place is tasty with plenty of highlights and a worthy successor to the original excellent izakaya."

I preferred the old food better and the cozy vibe of a Japanese restaurant, not another Izakaya Mew or Nonono.\nThe Motsu Nabe that I ordered, which I solely missed, taste was not the same. The soup used to be really clear with a hint of spice, really warms you up in a cold winter's day. This soup the motsu/meat were all small shredded pieces mostly collagen/fat. There used to be slices of meat that is completed replaced with these shredded pieces instead. The cabbage tasted a big grainy, not fresh or crispy.\nThe chili shrimp omelet was okay, quite sweet, and didn't expect the shrimp to be battered/covered.\nI heard the executive chef was the same so I had high hope, but this feels like just another establishment of the same restaurant group. Wish there is a better Motsu Nabe place in the city. (The one in east village was not bad)"

Then we had asked for the hotpot with the intestines not the one with chicken and again the server said ok and then brought out a dish with chicken in it. They acted annoyed about it and didn’t apologize.

We were a party of five so we order many things.\n\nNothing here was bad, however there were dishes that I wouldn’t recommend. The hot pot was expensive for the amount given and the taste was underwhelming. The Kani Harumaki was bland and while the presentation was pretty it was a mess to eat. The salt and pepper wings were nothing out of the ordinary and same goes for the fried rice.\n\nNow if you do decide to go. The Ebi Mayo was by far the best. The yuzu dishes here were all lovely, the Japanese citrus gives a nice tangy and sweet twist. Ebi Mayo was just that and the almond combined with the shrimp was the highlight of the time there. The yuzu pork belly was also great, although it’s garlic counter part was alright, not great not bad, a little bit salty. For drinks I had a raspberry strawberry mock tail that was not too sweet and had a nice tartness to it. Definitely a palate dependent drink.\n\nThis was also the first time I tried uni, or sea urchin. The scallops they were on was a bit underwhelming but the overall wasn’t bad. It’s worth a try for those who want to.\n\nWe ordered the dessert platter and I would say the Nama Pudding and Kocha Cheese Cake stood out the most. The pudding was the most creamy and smooth custard I’ve ever had. The kocha cheese cake was unique and a lovely to eat. The ice creams were nothing special. The green tea tofu was really light, with a barely there tint of sweetness.\n\nThe place is a great visit to try new things out. A good place to go with friends or take a date."

            "text": "Even better than before! Motsunabe or intestine hot pot is delicious. Very hearty especially for the winter. We tried many of the items and they were all excellent! The dessert platter was amazing. Service was great!\n\nThe whole tomato 🍅 salad was really refreshing. Great texture! Excellent flavor with the pickled onions and yuzu(?) flavor.\n\nThe veal liver sashimi is fresh! You can definitely taste the that irony livery texture. Great with the sesame dip.\n\nThe mapo tofu was surprisingly excellent! I would even say this us better than many of the szechuan eateries. Hakata does it right! The gravy is thick with that fragrant Mala flavor, just the right amount of spicy and tang. Came with rice. This was really excellent.\n\nThe nabe itself was hearty and pretty good portion of intestines vs vegetables ratio. We finished this with champon noodles. The small portion of noodles is actually very small for two people. It's really a SINGLE portion. But was okay for two since we had other dishes.\n\nAnd finally we had the dessert platter with hot tea. Great value because we tried several desserts and almost all were delicious. The earl grey tea cheesecake was super good. The sesame ice was on point! The sorbet was refreshing! The almond tofu pudding was surprisingly light!\n\nThe Macha ice cream is the only average item because there was no red bean paste and no mochi. I suggest adding some red bean paste and maybe a small mochi to top it.\n\nThe hot tea at the end is definitely appreciated! This small but necessary hot tea made the meal so much better. Intestine could be a bit heavy and oily so the hot tea was definitely great at the end for digestion.\n\nService was prompt and polite. Dishes came out on time and were cleared in good time.\n\nOverall a fantastic comeback!"

            "text": "A spacious authentic Japanese restaurant with beautiful food presentation and wonderful service.\n\nThe Yum Cha Set was big with a good assortment of small fresh dishes. My personal favs were the Sui Gyoza, a flavorful dumpling broth served in a teacup, and the Kani Harumaki, it’s similar to a taco with crab meat and glass noodles.\n\nGenmai-cha Tea was excellently roasted and went well with the meal, they refilled the tea jar for us too!\n\nThe Tonton Dessert Platter was a delight. Got to sample all their desserts, fell in love with the black sesame ice cream, so nutty, so good. The rest were amazing too! The green tea almond tofu was the only exception, it was such a weird combo. My friend wasn’t into it either so maybe it’s an acquired taste lol. It was aesthetic though as the matcha drizzled on top of the tofu.\n\nWhat better way way to end a stressful week than a delicious Sunday lunch on a beautiful sunny day. Both the sets we ordered were creative and exquisite. There was not a single person in that restaurant who wasn’t snapping pics 😂 It is expensive, but the food is of high-quality AND tasty. The staff were soooo sweet too! They greeted us in Japanese 🥹 Definitely a place worth revisiting, maybe next time we’ll try their famous hotpot!"

            "text": "I came here with a friend on a weekday night around 6:30PM with a reservation and we both enjoyed this place!\n\nFor drinks, we ordered a Kiwi Chu-hi & Straweberry Chu-hi (I think that’s what they were called). Pretty refreshing, the flavors were subtle but still tasted good.\nFor food, we ordered the Mentai Gnocchi, Citrus Salmon, and Tonton Hot Pot. The gnocchi was super soft and the mentaiko flavor was strong & really good. The citrus salmon was refreshing and delicious. The hot pot… 10/10!! It was full of vegetables and the broth was flavorful. When you have a little bit of broth and toppings left, they ask if you want to add rice or noodles (small or large size). We got a small size udon and it was lovely 😊\nFor dessert, we ordered the Kocha Cheese Cake, Roasted Goma Ice Cream. The ice cream was pretty good and I don’t even like sesame lol. The cheesecake was soft and light, it tasted good.\n\nI would definitely come back again to try their other dishes!"

            "text": "This new location is much more spacious than the old location, where it was almost impossible to get reservations the same week. Although I did not have a reservation, I was able to sit down and walk-in around 5:45, they did warn me that I need to free up my table by 7:30 for people with actual reservation. Service is fast, 1.5 hours would be ample to order and eat. Staff very friendly and accommodating, menu has also expanded with a lot of interesting choices, which allows for people who do not want to venture into the intestine or the trotter hotpots Must try their grilled prom trotters, I personally favor the garlic one because I’m a huge cilantro fan, but the ponzu and fashioned are also excellent choices. The new dessert menu is much better suited to western palates."

The truffle cream was the highlight. Great appetizer.\nTONTON HOT POT was mild spicy and with lots of veggies. I like the flavor but hope there are more tofu and chicken in it. We added udon at the end of the meal. Very fulfilling.\nKOCHA CHEESECAKE stole the spotlight of the dinner. Rich cheesecake but the black tea flavor and lemon zest balanced the whole dessert. Really spot on!!!\nStaff was so helpful and friendly. The dining environment was clean and organized too. Nothing can be complained about this place."

Same price at any cafe in ktown would cost you double and might not even taste as good."

            "text": "Our party of four came in on a Friday with a 7:30 resso. I had been to their West Village location years back (which I think is also closed now) but only had the hot pot. This time, we ordered other things to try in addition to the hot pot. We kind of made up our own little tasting menu and shared all the plates. We had:\n\nLiver sashimi (Veal liver sashimi with sesame oil, salt, and Pajang sauce) - I wasn't sure what to expect because I like liver but have never had liver sashimi before. It definitely tastes very different. The texture is also chewy but slightly crunchy. This wasn't for me\n\nCitrus salmon (Atlantic salmon with salmon roe, red onion, jalapeno and lemon dressing) - can't go wrong with salmon sashimi. It sounds like there's a lot going on but all the flavors worked well with each other\n\nChicken karaage (Japanese fried chicken with mala mayo) - another classic. When in doubt, just go with the fried chicken\n\nKatsu sandwich (Japanese pork fillet cutlet sandwich with Japanese mustard butter) - I can't remember if I liked this or not. Nothing really stood out to me\n\nYakiniku wrap (Barbecue washu beef with scallion pancake, lettuce, pickled vegetables, and mayo) - kind of basic and not worth the $16\n\nGyu tongue (beef tongue with ginger scallion sauce) - very tender. I really liked the ginger scallion sauce\n\nYuzu miso pork (Pork belly with Sichuan pepper and yuzu miso sauce) - I remember this being a bit dry\n\nKani harumaki (Blend of snow crab, pork, mushroom and vegetables. Served with spring roll skin) - also pretty basic.\n\nEbi mayo (shrimp with roasted almond, fresh cherry, and yuzu mayo) - I liked the yuzu mayo\n\nHakata roll (Amberjack roll with scallions wrapped in amberjack, shiso, and spicy cod roe) - too much shiso but other than that, the roll was good\n\nUni scallop (seared scallop with sea urchin) - what's not to love about uni or scallop? This was the crowd favorite of the night\n\nSmall Motsu hot pot \"white\" (Chicken bonito broth with beef intestine, cabbage, chives, and dumpling skin) - this was very flavorful and the broth tasted really clean. The veggies were a nice addition after indulging in such rich dishes earlier in the evening. But by the time the hot pot came, we were already pretty full.\n\nEven though we ordered so many things, there are still a bunch of other dishes I'd like to try, so I'll definitely be back!"

Sashimi was super fresh and tasty, my friend actually said it was even better than an omakase he went to.  Didn't even get a chance to snap a picture.  The citrus salmon, wasabi kanpachi and pork skewers are great too.  The ton ton fried rice and katsu sandwich were just ok, I would skip.  Tasty drinks too, I recommend the hinoki for the old fashioned lovers.  For dessert , the black sesame ice cream was the star, and I don't usually like black sesame.

And service is great.\n\nEvery dish here is amazing - black cod, pork belly skewers, garlic fried rice, etc. But what everyone comes for is their pork flavored hot pot. It is so savory. The mountain of chives not only looks amazing but I also love the taste. I can never have enough of it. The new location does not offer add-ons on their menu like the old one. Also no options of rice or noodles in the pot at the end. But still everything tastes amazing and I will be back for more.\n\nSince the space is so much bigger, the wait is much more manageable. My group didn't really have to wait long arriving around 6:30 on a Saturday night."
