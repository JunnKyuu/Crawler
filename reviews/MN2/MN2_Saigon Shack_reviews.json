I can see why they wouldn’t want to give these out of people don’t use them but if personally could have used more."

This pho should be straight banging but despite all that it does not live up to the billing. The pho chicken was rubbery. The bag of add ins was sparse. The broth was firmly classifiable as nothing special and where there should be an herbal almost medicinal quality to good pho broth it was just kinda sweet. Good pho should have the same restorative, ease creating, heart opening quality that every other cultures oldest soups share. Matzo ball. Korean chigae, pozole. The woman next to me at the counter said she had been going for 10 years and that they had indeed lost their touch. She said try China town. The bahn mi was alright but similarly nothing special."

She always showed her annoyance on her face. Because of that attitude, she was impatient when taking the order, leading to the wrong dish. Although I emphasized many times that I chose rice for that dish. But when it was brought out, it was still noodles. Normally, if the service brought out the wrong dish, I would still happily take it and not change it back. But because of the waitress's very bad service attitude, I had to force her to change it back to what I requested. To the waitress. If you feel upset and annoyed when you go to work, you should get a day off at home. Because going to work with an unpleasant face towards customers is really unfair. Because after eating, I still had to tip 20% for the bad service that I should not have received. In addition, with her bad face, customers will not want to come back and affect the owner's business."

Se andate alla ricerca di qualcosa di diverso dai soliti panini qua i ramen e gli involtini di primavera si avvicinano molto a quelli “originali” (avvicinano, ho detto). Per non farvi fare un viaggio a vuoto, sul posto accettano solo pagamento “cash only”. Non so se sia una cosa temporanea o solo per turisti: è ben visibile sul menu ma anche loro ti avvisano prima di farti ordinare. Non vi fate impressionare da un po’ di fumo proveniente dalle griglie elettriche a vista… è vietnamita anche quello!! 😂"

Service was fast, and the food came out hot and fresh.\n\nWe ordered the brisket pho, pork chop with vermicelli, and the pork and shrimp spring rolls.\n\nThe pork and shrimp spring rolls were smaller than expected, but they were crispy and served piping hot. The flavors were good, though I would’ve liked a slightly larger portion.\n\nThe brisket pho came with thinner noodles than I’m used to, but it worked well. There was a generous amount of brisket, and the portion was big enough to share with my daughter. It was flavorful without being overly salty. You can definitely taste the MSG—it gives the broth that rich, savory depth that makes it so satisfying. I just wish it had been served hotter; I prefer my soup hot-hot.\n\nThe pork chop with vermicelli was delicious—according to my partner, who enjoyed every bite.\n\nI’d recommend both dishes.\n\nThe seating is limited and the space is small, so I suggest coming early.\n\nThere is outdoor and indoor seating available."
