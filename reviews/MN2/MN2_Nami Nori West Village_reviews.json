That level of responsibility and care is rare.\n\nOnce I arrived, the atmosphere was stylish yet welcoming, and the hand-rolls were beautifully made and fresh. It’s clearly a place with both flair and quality.\n\nIf I’m being completely honest, a couple of the more experimental rolls were a bit too over-the-top for my taste. But overall, it was a very good experience — one I’d recommend when you’re looking for something a bit special and well-handled."

The kitchen seemed to be understaffed and hectic. It took a very long time for us to get each piece. Unlikely to go back again."

            "text": "Nami nori is a small restaurant, but a hidden gem. 100% gluten free.\n\nI ordered the signature set, and my friend ordered the starter set. I traded my coconut shrimp with her yellowtail jalapeño Tamaki roll. Everything was so delicious. My favorites in my set were the XO Scallop (it was spicy, citrus-y, and so delicious - and I don't normally eat raw scallops) and the Tuna Poke. I also enjoyed the yellowtail, salmon seranno, and cucumber sesame plum.\n\nI like how they had the starter sets/signature sets so it was more cost efficient, but when I go back I hope to try the spicy crab dynamite and red crab California. Love this place!!\n\nPS: Matcha was delicious and authentic!"

The service was very slow, and even after insisting several times to be seated indoors, nothing happened.\n\nWe only chose this place because it was listed on the Blackbird app and had been on our list for a long time. However, at the end of the meal, they told us they weren’t accepting payments through the app — another unpleasant surprise.\n\nDefinitely do not recommend. Worst experience we’ve had in a long time.\n\nBy the way, they have a B rating for sanitary conditions, which is quite concerning for a sushi place."

Also smaller portion of tuna dip.\nBut the deplorable service is what turns me off. Waitress seemed most disinterested. Hands me the bill and proceeds to chat with colleagues and be so engrossed in something else other than helping with the chq. I mean, if you would like me to leave without paying, sure! This place used to have better rep. Only the Mexican server was great service - he actually asked me how i was and looked me in the eye - wow service. The caucasian waitress should not be customer facing. Place her in the back is my advice!"

My partner and I arrived at 9:00 pm and were told by the hostess to wait 25 minutes for a table. She put us on the waiting list, took my number, and we waited outside as usual. At 9:25, I checked in—she said the table still wasn’t ready and that if no one left by 9:30, we wouldn’t be seated, as the kitchen would be closing. At exactly 9:31, we were happy to see that multiple tables got up. We approached again, only to be told—rudely—that because it was now 9:31, we wouldn’t be seated. We were absolutely stunned. After being told to wait outside for 30 minutes, we were denied a table over one minute. I’ve never experienced such classless treatment anywhere in the world. Thankfully, the restaurant next door welcomed us warmly and even served us after closing, simply because they couldn’t believe how we had been treated by Nami Nori. Truly disappointing experience."

Nice staff although it felt like there was some chaos behind the counter and our rolls took a long time between rounds.

The service was good and the environment was a bit cramped (which I understand space is limited in NYC). But the fish quality was way below my expectations. I thought for a specialty restaurant known for their handrolls their fish would be close to omakase quality however this was not the case. I would compare the tuna and salmon quality to that of which I have had in a $13 poke bowl in NJ (possibly lower). I think my $9 cup of clam miso soup was my favorite part of the meal. I mean no disrespect, but just wanted to share my opinion to hopefully save someone else from disappointment, or for the restaurant to see this and make some changes."

            "text": "Went for an early dinner on a weekend and the place was bustling. Place is small with a trendy bar counter setting. While service didn’t feel rushed, we were in and out in less than an hour perhaps because of the concept where the food was served pretty quickly and the cramped seating doesn’t make it comfortable to order more for a longer duration. The shisato pepper had an unusually intense spiciness (we are not new to this dish but somehow the particular batch was really too strong) that we could not finish. Ordered a variety of rolls which were mostly ok, some rather meh. The only notable was the nori which was consistently super crisp. My biggest discomfort with the place was that the ‘chefs’ (counter hand roll prep people) were not using gloves or wearing masks and they were talking to one another all the time over the rolls that they were making.  Also, they do allow you to order less than than 5 rolls if you want, although I had ordered the full 5 just to try out. Go if you are into the hip vibes or a quick fill if willing to splurge on overpriced temaki."

From the moment you step inside, the sleek yet cozy ambiance draws you in, with blonde-wood benches adorned with soft gray-blue pillows and two U-shaped counters that make the art of temaki hand-rolled sushi the star of the show.\n\nThe open layout creates an intimate, communal vibe, perfect for watching the chefs craft each dish with precision and care.\nThe menu is a celebration of creativity and flavor, with temaki taking center stage alongside thoughtfully curated offerings like the vegetable miso soup with fried tofu and shishito, which is both comforting and vibrant. The chef’s set is a must for adventurous diners, delivering unexpected yet harmonious combinations like salmon, onion cream, and tomato wrapped in crisp, toasted nori. Each bite is a revelation, with textures and flavors that feel both innovative and familiar. Standouts include the chopped toro on wasabi rice, sprinkled with scallions for a punchy, melt-in-your-mouth experience, and the broiled crab with spicy mayo, served in a nori shell studded with rice crackers—a playful, crunchy delight that’s as fun to eat as it is delicious.\nVegan diners are far from an afterthought here. The plant-based options are just as inventive and satisfying, showcasing Nami Nori’s commitment to inclusivity without sacrificing flavor. Every dish feels intentional, with fresh ingredients and bold seasonings that elevate the meal to something truly special.\n\nWhether you’re a sushi aficionado or just looking for a fresh take on Japanese cuisine, Nami Nori delivers a memorable experience that’s as visually appealing as it is delicious. It’s a spot that invites you to linger, savor, and return for more."

Or, the managers/hosts don't know what they're doing.\nIt was my first visit. I had heard that this place was great. Someone even assured me that it is better than Kazu Nori. Which I didn't believe and still don't believe. Although, the menu here is more interesting and creative.\nWe sat outside, which can be awkward. There are three (3) tables. A lot of people walking by and people standing and waiting for their reservations. We started with Braised Bamboo Shoots and Japanese Potato Salad. Both (2) were good. We tried many Temaki. Cucumber Black Sesame, Spicy Tuna, Toro Scallion, \"Avocado Toast\", Salmon Avocado, Yellow Tail,...and some others. Everything was good. There is an interesting way you help to prepare the Temaki at the table. They bring a box to the table with the seaweed wrappers and you prepare the final step. It's not a big deal and it's kind of 'fun'.\nFor dessert we tried the Churros with Lemon Cream. Those were really impressive. The lemon cream was well balanced. The service was excellent and our main waiter from a small town in Mexico was fantastic.\nOverall, I liked it. I would go back and try other things. But, I would need a solid reservation and no waiting.\n(I added bad photos with my review.)"

Once seated at the sushi bar, the vibe was really nice: clean, modern, and stylish inside. The menu is simple, not too many items, but they also have drinks (including alcohol).\n\nI went with the five-piece set (about $30–35). Portions were decent and I left feeling full. The fish was fresh, but not every roll hit the mark for me. Some flavor combos felt a little overhyped — one had a sesame/soy combo that leaned too salty, another had jalapeño that overpowered the fish, and there was a roll with lemon zest that was just… a bit odd.\n\nOverall, not a bad spot for lunch and definitely an experience to try once. I might come back for dinner to see if it’s different, but I wouldn’t call it one of the best hand roll places in NYC. Worth checking out for the ambiance and presentation, though!"

The interior is clean and minimal, and the prices are relatively reasonable. The dishes are well-presented and neatly arranged, but the flavors and aromas are quite strong.\nI ordered the signature set, and I still remember the sharp wasabi hit from the first bite and the overpowering ssamjang (fermented soybean paste) flavor on the sauce over cucumbers at the end. Although it’s a fusion Japanese restaurant, the taste was much bolder than I expected, which left me a bit disappointed.\nAs I walked out, I couldn’t help but wonder, was it really necessary to wrap such crisp, fried ingredients in seaweed? It’s a place worth trying once, but I wouldn’t say it’s a must-visit."
