Brunello wine + limoncello + chocolate hazelnut cake with crème anglaise for dessert was the perfect ending.\n\nThe only service fault was that the waiter placed our clam order on another table, it sat on the other table for a bit, then he tried to serve it to us. We spoke to a manager who apologized and swiftly had the kitchen prepare a new clam dish. Happy with the resolution."

The atmosphere was vibrant yet elegant, and the service was warm and attentive from start to finish. Every dish was flavorful and beautifully presented — especially the pasta, which was cooked to perfection. It felt like the kind of meal you savor and remember. Definitely a place I’d recommend for a special night out or to celebrate something meaningful."

Yes, reservations can be tough to get (you’ll need to book about 30 days in advance), but trust me, it’s absolutely worth it. Dining here is more than just a meal — it’s an experience. The atmosphere is timeless, elevated, and makes you feel genuinely special whether you’re there for lunch or dinner.\n\nMy go-to cocktail is the Whiskey Smash, crafted with a quality Scotch — perfectly balanced and refreshing (thank me later!). As for the food, you truly can’t go wrong with anything on the menu. The Spicy Rigatoni Vodka and Tortellini al Ragù are must-tries, and Mario’s Meatballs are an instant favorite. To finish, the Lemon Cheesecake is the perfect way to end the night — light, rich, and full of flavor.\n\nCarbone never disappoints — it’s the kind of place that reminds you why New York dining is world-class. A true culinary experience from start to finish."

Book early and try a late lunch for a relaxed experience.\n\nCarbone lived up to its reputation. We were visiting from LA and didn’t know what to expect, but from the moment we walked in the staff made us feel welcome. The energy is old school but fun. Our server was easily one of the best parts of the night, he was attentive, charismatic, and clearly proud of what he does. That kind of service makes a big difference.\n\nThe red sauce pastas are the star here, but everything we tried had great flavor. The Caesar was sharp and balanced, and the cocktails were spot on. We came for a late lunch, which was perfect since dinner gets packed. The whole meal felt smooth, unhurried, and well worth planning ahead for.\n\nIf you can get a reservation, do it. The food, service, and atmosphere all line up exactly the way you hope they will"

A HUGE thank you to the manager Alfonso, bartender Chi Chi, and our servers Marco & Carlos. Amaretto Sour is my go-to drink and Chi Chi made the best one I’ve ever tasted yet! We ordered the Caesar salad, spicy rigatoni, lobster ravioli, the meatballs, and lemon cheesecake. They were all prepared and cooked to perfection! The staff definitely made the experience for my boyfriend Alfonso & I memorable. I appreciate all the hospitality and love theyprovided throughout the night. Their service went above and beyond and exceeded all my expectations. They treated my boyfriend and I like family. This was a perfect 11pm late dinner spot. Cant wait to be back and experience this all over again - I already have another reservation booked next month!"

Highlights included the light and airy Carbone meatball (never thought I’d describe a meatball light & airy!), rigatoni, and lobster ravioli; all perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Since I was with a larger group, I really appreciated the thoughtful service of pre-splitting the rigatoni and serving it individually on our own plates.\n\nThe cozy, intimate Greenwich Village restaurant has that classic New York charm and the menus are hilariously oversized for such a tiny space. You practically need your own table just to open one!"

            "text": "I really, Really, REALLY wanted to be unimpressed by Carbone. If you've ever tried to get a reservation there, you know why. To say it is difficult is an understatement. However, I was able to snag a reservation on my birthday, which was perfect because my wife was really looking forward to it. I warned her in advance: don't get your hopes up...we've been to several 3 Star Michelin restaurants and hype-y places tend to be overrated. That was my wishful thinking and goodness, was I wrong.\n\nFirst, the atmosphere. Close but not cramped. Well-decorated. And enough room on the table to actually eat.\n\nSecond, and definitely the most important other than the food, is the service. When a restaurant is popular, the staff can get a bit snooty. When a restaurant has enjoyed the massive popularity for the time Carbone has enjoyed it, I expected nothing less than inattentive waitstaff at best and maybe even rude at worst. Again, Carbone proved me wrong.\n\nFrom the host stand to the waiters to the manager coming by to check on us and engage us in conversation the entire time, it *literally* (as in, the accurate use of that word) made us feel like family. To say everyone was friendly and helpful would be an understatement. The people at the table adjoining us were enjoying their meal and the lady, in her excitement was taking pictures of the surroundings. The staff jumped right in and helped her take pictures and took pictures of her and her husband. The entire house had an amazing vibe as a result of the staff and we left there feeling like we had made friends.\n\nThird, the food. Look, like I said before I wanted it to be \"meh.\" Why? Because this place is hard to book and I wanted to not want to eat there again. But dang it, the food was incredible. So much so that we \"over ordered\" for the two of us and still ate every single morsel until we were completely fat, dumb, and happy.\n\nI'm not a foodie so I can't tell you every last detail of every course we had...you can read all about that in hundreds of other reviews.\n\nBut what I will say is that Carbone is one of those places you believe (and in my case, hope) is just another popular spot that doesn't live up to the frenzy...and then it easily does and the memory of that meal and experience stays with you forever.\n\nThank you to the staff and management of Carbone for making my birthday meal very special. And darn you because now every time I'm in the city I'm going to have to play the reservation game to get a table because I will be back again and again."

From the time we stepped in, to the end of our meal, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. As we walked to the back, everyone greeted us with a smile, checked on us constantly, and the dropping and clearing of our entrées was timed like a ballet. With tables close, we had a great chat with some locals, but we have to say, our server, Mark stole the show. Engaging, informative, willing to mix and match foods (you can’t go wrong with splitting the Branzino and rigatoni)  not to mention his great sense of humor (even giving a nod to my oblique Fargo reference!), he was a highlight of our trip and finding gems like this keeps us coming back to NYC every year at this time!"

            "text": "Our meal at Carbone was almost 3 hours long and full of delicious food from beginning to end. Recommend going in a group and eating family style.\n\nThe two above average drinks were definitely the Negroni and the espresso martini. I wouldn’t recommend the other cocktails in comparison.\n\nThe table starters were a delicious, crispy garlic bread, a soft tomato bread, cauliflower in an acidic drizzle, and pieces of wheat sesame bread. The garlic and tomato breads were exactly how you want them.\n\nTableside Caesar salad has plenty of parm and a wonderful dressing with a spicy kick/twist to it. Somewhat unique and subtle spin on a classic dish. Just like the Carbone menus, the croutons were also comically large.\n\nWords can’t describe the spicy rigatoni, which everyone and their grandmother has heard about. Creamy, small kick of spicy, and symphony of flavors all dancing in your mouth, textured onto al dente pasta. Best dish of the meal.\n\nThe spaghetti pomodoro was similar to the Caesar salad in that it has a subtle Carbone-twist while maintaining the core of the dish. Strong basil flavor and very well made sauce.\n\nThe fettuccine al funghi has a light mushroom flavor with a soft oil glaze. The flavors were not saturated and overall paled in comparison to its spicy vodka sibling. Wouldn’t recommend this one.\n\nBroccoli rabe is probably an acquired taste, but we thought it was wayyy too bitter to finish. Skip.\n\nThe desserts were all solid but unfortunately nothing to write home about. The rainbow cookies were very chocolatey and dense, tiramisu was moist and light-medium, carrot cake was thick (best dessert if I had to choose), and the pistachio gelato was very very (read: too) rich.\n\nService was top notch, and felt more genuine/“straight up” than most Michelin restaurants. Waiter was a no-bullshit type guy and accommodating to our parties’ dietary restrictions. 5/5."

Our waiter was a little rehearsed but well meaning, and the rest of the staff were top notch.\n\nThe meal! The grandma bread to start was a highlight - all the complimentary starters are good. We had mixed drinks - try the cafe reposado - the rest was average. We could’ve skipped the calamari - it was good but there’s a limit to how special fried squid can be, and it’s not worth taking up room in your stomach. The mixed salad was good - a little overdressed for me, but a nice way to mix in some fresh veggies. Spicy rigatoni - perfect. We got 1 meatball - the waiter, to his credit, urged us to get just one to try so that we didn’t over order. I really appreciated that. Veal parm was SO good. It had mixed reviews, but I think it’s a highlight - be sure to try the meat on the bone - the table next to us simply discarded it! For dessert we had the carrot cake after we were told the hazelnut cake was retired. It was good, and actually better the next day since we ended up taking most of it home. When you leave, take a baci chocolate candy at the door. All in all I’ll be back!"

            "text": "@lydieats 💕 There are too many new openings in the city that you often forget about classic ones. BUT never Carbone. Still one of the hardest tables to book and for good reason.\n\nMy fav part is the complimentary garlic bread with salami and mozerella. Hits every time. Esp that cheese 🙂‍↕️👏 Start with the carpaccio or the salad, both pretty salty so def better with a drink. I rly like the carpaccio, it’s super thin, like spoon-scrapping, so it teases your appetite without filling it.\n\nFor pasta, no words needed for the spicy vodka rigatoni 🙆‍♀️ This dish is what American Italian is built on. Tortellini is solid. Get it if that’s your thing. I think the meatballs are another must and I don’t even like minced meat. They’re good and make the rigatoni taste even better? If you’re strong enough for desserts, get the hazelnut cake but you didn’t do it right if you still have space for that.\n\n💕 carpaccio piemontese $34*\n💕 yellowtail crudo MP\n💕 spicy vodka rigatoni $34*\n💕 tortellini al ragu $35\n💕 mario’s meatballs $27*\n\n영원한 클래식. 수많은 뉴욕 식당중에서 Carbone처럼 오랫동안 사랑받는 곳은 다 이유가 있다. 여기 리가토니는 긴말 필요없는 레전드 디쉬 🫶 미국 이탈리안의 정석이다. 기본찬(?)으로 주시는 마늘빵이랑 살라미 & 치즈도 너무 맛있음!! 저녁보다는 점심때가 예약하기 쉬우니까 도전해보기."

The food itself is solid - we especially loved the spicy rigatoni and the eggplant and zucchini app. The spicy rigatoni is simply very well balanced and I liked the onions. The eggplant dish had a good kick to it and was very flavorful. Only the meatball was not quite up to my friend’s grandma’s recipe, but that’s tough competition. The complimentary breads and cheese were excellent and really made the dinner feel complete. Extra shoutout to the sommelière for teaching us about the history of champagne and being fun to talk to! Also, our waiter was very informative and attentive. Having worked in restaurants myself I feel that this is a place that cherishes itself and its staff. A NYC gem."

Our server was good and attentive, but the experience did feel a bit rushed, which felt off given the ~$500–600 spend for a table of four. That said, the overall ambience and classic dishes still make it a “must-visit-once” kind of spot, especially if you’re into the New York dining scene."

My biggest issue was we had a party of 10 and last minute someone popped in which put us at 11 and they were beyond inflexible (known for this...).  I appreciate they have rules but when you have a relatively small party spending $8-10k for 3 hours (they are pretty strict about turning the tables 2x per evening), it seems reasonable you make the rare exception."

We ordered too much because the staff was a bit pushy and reckoned we should order one more pasta. If we knew the potatoes Louie was in such a bit portion, we would have order the ravioli.\nThe highlight was the deconstructed carrot cake. I think it was the best dish out of those we ordered."

The food is exquisite, the flavors of each dish are perfect, nothing is overwhelming, and the recommendation from the “captain” to share was more than perfect. From the starters like the Caesar salad, prosciutto, and Calamari Marco, to the main courses like the Spicy Rigatoni Vodka and the Pork Chop & Peppers, everything was incredible. The wait for the reservation is definitely worth it.\n\nThe entire staff serves with great charisma and a positive attitude. We loved Carbone and hope to return.

From the moment you walk in, you’re transported to a glamorous, old-school New York Italian restaurant—but with a modern, elevated twist. The service is exceptional—attentive without being overbearing—and every dish is prepared with precision and passion.\n\nThe spicy rigatoni vodka is hands-down one of the best pasta dishes I’ve ever had—perfectly al dente and packed with flavor. The veal parmesan is a showstopper, both in size and taste. And don’t skip the Caesar salad—it’s prepared tableside and feels like a performance in itself.\n\nIt’s definitely a special-occasion spot, but worth every penny for the experience.

The food did come out quite slowly especially towards the end. I think the tortellini and salmon can be skipped, nothing special. I don’t hear many people discuss the potatoes so please try it! You’ve never had potatoes like this before. I want to try some of the other pastas when I go back. The menus are comically large and the tables are unfortunately small. The music is a bit too loud in my opinion to really have conversation with your table. I’m fine with oldies (I think 50-60s) but just bring down the volume. It’s a nice vibe in there though. Rainbow cookies sucked to me"

As many know, they only do reservations through Resy unless you're VERY lucky to get a walk in. Be prepared to wait for a long time to get in this place. Though it WILL be worth it. The restaurant is very small yet you do not feel squished. I would say no more than 15 tables between the few small exquisite rooms. I will start with the restaurant. It is beautiful inside and out. The perfect New York experience (if you are not from there). Otherwise as New Yorkers you know what I mean. There are quite a few Italian restaurants across the boroughs but I did enjoy this one. I would say do your research first before dining in so you know what to order to make your experience full rounded. The staff is very professional and you WILL receive top tier industry service. My server was Marcos and he was very kind and efficient. On to the food. I ordered the table side caesar salad and I do not say this lightly that it was one of the best caesar salads I've ever had. They make the dressing and salad all from scratch table side and the taste backs that up. The dressing had such a deep, delicious flavor and do not even get me started on the massive croutons. All excellent. For my starters I also ordered the oysters which was also very good. For my main course I ordered the spicy rigatoni and veal parm which are both staples. The pasta oh my gosh was it good. Be prepared it does have a kick to it but it wasn't overwhelming. By the time I got to dessert I didn't have room but I would be open to trying it for the next visit when I very much look forward to my return.\n\nI wanted to write a separate dedicated message to compliment your manager Brandon. He is splendid and truly a great person. Very professional and displayed great communication to make my birthday lunch enjoyable and memorable.\n\nThank you Carbone!"

A famous restaurant. A tried and true recipe. Keeping it simple.\n\nHowwwweeevverr, I feel like sometimes the greatest barometer  of a how great a resturant is can be measured through either  their most popular or simplest dish.\n\nNOW THAT MOZZARELLA WITH THE SALAMI AND BREAD STARTER WAS DELICIOUS. Maybe I was just hungry lol\n\nAlso the cucumber  lemonade was refreshing, not overly sweet, slight saltiness that really complimented  the appetizer\n\nMaybe on another day, it could be better but I don't know if the reservation  wait time is worth it.\n\nAnyway...\n\nEAT swell friends"
