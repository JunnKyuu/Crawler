The best iconic dishes like tea pork belly and green onion beef slices were removed and replaced by generic heavy sauce sauté dishes. Also tasted like too much MSG than before. Hope they go back to the previous tasty level. I might not be back even though I visited 10+ times. It’s so sad."

We were blown away at how delicious the cabbage with chili oil was, and it's complimentary when you sit down. We're trying to figure out how to make it at home because we need it in our lives but can't drive down to NYC often lol. Everything was absolutely delicious!! The staff were super nice, especially when my fiance accidentally spilled his drink on the floor.\n\nThe menu is on an tablet they give you. All the items have pictures, which is super helpful! And you can add things to your cart like you're shopping. You send it to the kitchen and a server comes and confirms the order with you.\n\nDefinitely coming back here!"

            "text": "TL;DR: Solid Sichuan-leaning spot in Chinatown. Spicy chicken wontons are a must. Braised beef tripe with potato is tasty but fatty. Milk-foam tea is smooth, not too sweet. Quick service and a clean room.\n\nFound Jian Nan after a nearby viral place was overbooked. Got seated fast and food came out hot. I am not usually into dumplings but the soup dumplings here were really good. The Spicy Chicken Wontons were excellent as well, soft wrappers, sesame, good heat. Note the peanut element for anyone with allergies. The Braised Beef Tripe with Potato had deep flavor, but the meat leaned fatty for me, about 7.5 out of 10. Chicken Fried Rice was classic and not greasy. The Peach Oolong Tea with Milk Foam was balanced and refreshing.\n\nTotal was about $90 before tip for dishes and drinks. Fair for the quality and portions.\n\nPro tips:\n• Order the spicy wontons and/or soup dumplings\n• Skip the tripe if you prefer lean cuts.\n• The milk-foam tea is worth adding.\n• Expect around $25 to $35 per person."

            "text": "This is hands down the BEST Chinese restaurant in NYC — and I don’t say that lightly. If you’re looking for truly authentic Chinese food, Jiangnan is the place. What makes it so special is that it’s not limited to one region; here you’ll find dishes from Beijing, Shanghai, Canton, and Sichuan, all executed beautifully.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we ordered some of our all-time favorites: 清炒丝瓜 (stir-fried loofah), 江南小笼包 (soup dumplings), 红油抄手 (wontons in chili oil), 蒜泥白肉 (sliced pork belly with garlic sauce), 桂花糯米藕 (sticky rice stuffed lotus root with osmanthus), 黑松露脆豆腐 (crispy tofu with black truffle), and 银耳羹 (white fungus dessert soup). Every single dish was perfection — fresh, flavorful, and made with such care. The balance of flavors, the textures, and even the presentation always remind me of home-cooked meals but elevated to something unforgettable.\n\nJiangnan also holds a very special place in our hearts. When my husband and I were just dating, the very first family dinner with my mom happened here. Now, years later, after marriage and countless meals together, we just came back for what must be our 20th visit — again with my mom. The consistency and warmth of this restaurant have been part of our family story.\n\nIf you want an authentic, heartfelt Chinese dining experience in New York, this is your go-to spot. Jiangnan is not just a restaurant — it’s a place where memories are made, one incredible dish at a time."

Each dish was surprisingly well-balanced and thoughtfully seasoned. The duck had perfectly crisp skin and was bursting with flavor. The fried rice, though made with an unexpected mix of ingredients, came together in the most harmonious way. As for the eggplant, it was uniquely seasoned and definitely worth a try at least once.\n\nThe space feels both elegant and comfortable, making it ideal for a relaxed yet refined dining experience. Service was a bit inconsistent: one server was attentive and friendly, while another seemed less engaged when taking our order.\n\nThat said, this is the kind of place I’d happily bring someone special to a partner, a friend, family member, or even a business guest. It strikes a lovely balance between elevated cuisine and inviting atmosphere."

Both drinks were presented beautifully and tasted just as good as they looked.For food, we started with the pork dumpling soup, which was comforting and flavorful. The deep fried tofu was perfectly crisp on the outside, soft inside and very well seasoned. The kimchi fried rice were bold, tangy, and addictive definitely a must-try. To top it all off, we had the crème brûlée for dessert, and it was flawless: creamy, smooth, with that satisfying caramelized sugar crack on top.Overall, this place struck the perfect balance of atmosphere, attentive service, and thoughtfully prepared food. It’s the kind of spot you can enjoy on a casual night out but still feels special. Highly recommend!"

Honestly, I was really disappointed.\n\nThe first time I ever tried the Jiang Nan brand was at their Flushing location in Queens, and that experience was amazing. The food quality, service, and overall management were top-notch. But coming to the Chinatown location in Manhattan today left me quite let down.\n\nI ordered three dishes: a crab soup (with rice), a fried duck roll, and smoked pork. To be honest, these should’ve been signature dishes, but for some reason, everything I had today tasted really fishy and off.\n\nFirst, the crab soup—it had such a strong fishy smell. After mixing it with rice, I took just one bite and couldn’t continue. It was completely inedible for me. No one from the staff came to check in or ask how the food was, or if I had any concerns. That soup honestly made me feel sick.\n\nAs for the smoked pork, it tasted more like ham—not at all like what I had in Flushing. The quality was just nowhere near comparable.\n\nAnd then there was the environment. The lighting was extremely dim and gray, making it hard to even see the food on the table. Like, could they please do something about the lighting?\n\nLastly, the service was honestly not good. It didn’t feel like the Jiang Nan I remembered. Overall, I can only give it three stars. Very disappointed. I won’t be coming back."

It’s bold, aromatic, and totally addictive. The broth is loaded with extras like lotus root, potato slices, enoki mushrooms, and wide glass noodles — all soaking up that glorious spicy flavor. The Spicy Boiled Beef (Shuizhuniurou) was equally impressive — juicy, flavorful beef in a numbing chili oil broth with plenty of veggies. Perfectly executed.\n\nDrinks: Matcha Latte & Osmanthus Latte\nAfter the heat, we cooled off with two surprisingly good lattes — the Matcha Latte had a strong green tea aroma and was topped with a beautiful matcha leaf design, while the Osmanthus Latte was lightly floral and soothing, with delicate dried osmanthus sprinkled on the frothy top. Both were creamy, balanced, and a perfect match for the spice.\n\nAmbience & Service:\nThe three Michelin plaques on the wall immediately set the tone. The space is modern with tasteful Chinese elements, clean and cozy, and the staff were friendly and attentive.\n\nVerdict:\nIf you’re a spice lover or a fan of authentic Sichuan cuisine, this place is a must. The Pickled Chili Sea Bass alone is worth the trip. Add in great drinks and a solid atmosphere — it’s easily one of my new go-to spots!"

Love the decor, ambience and the ordering system.\nIt was very easy to find what I wanted to eat with the iPad and seeing visuals was helpful too.\n\nI should preface by saying that I have had Peking duck all over the US and several countries in Asia. Many friends and family have recommended Jiang Nan to me specifically for the duck.\n\nI was really disappointed in the Peking duck. Presentation was phenomenal. But the breast meat and the dark meat was dried out and only certain pieces of the skin were crispy. Even some of the cucumbers and scallions were dried out. With the half duck price point at ~50 dollars and full duck at ~100 dollars I don’t think I would come here again.\n\nTruffle soup dumplings and the salt and pepper duck bones were amazing though!"

            "text": "Ok this place is soooooooo good. I knew based on being 4.8 stars in NYC with 100's of reviews it was going to be a good experience, but I'm beyond impressed. Let's start with the service. Front of house has been impeccable. Courteous prompt service, good help navigating the expansive menu, tasteful decor and light piano music for atmosphere. All good. The dish presentation was also top notch. Didn't expect the show with the pineapple beer, but beyond being delicious, it's the kind of extra touch that makes a meal memorable.\n\nOn to the food. We started with the black truffle soup dumplings. Very nice and the burst of flavor makes it such a wonderful bite. We had marbled beef in golden soup and eggplant in garlic and pork sauce. The latter an excellent rendition of a classic Chinese dish, while the former was new to us and remarkable. Both with a tad of spice (we were cautioned, again great attention to guest comfort by front of house staff) our taste buds were singing by this time. We finished with the peach gummies for dessert, delicious light and perfect. Not to heavy or overly sweet. Top marks to back of house for delighting us too.\n\nBottom line, affordable indulgence, TEN stars."

The cumin lamb was perfectly seasoned and tender, while the eel showcased that refined regional preparation style beautifully.

Don’t miss the cumin lamb and eel - they’re absolutely worth the visit. Highly recommended!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"

I also ordered the kumquat lemon tea and a peach tea. The drinks were equally amazing. This place has won a Michelin star the last three years. Everything they brought out looked amazing.

If you’re looking for a restaurant with amazing atmosphere, great service, and high-quality food at a reasonable price, this is the place to go.\n\nFor the price you’re paying—around $30 per person (or up to $50 if you go all out)—the experience is incredible. At just $30, you’ll already leave feeling satisfied. Compared to most other restaurants in NYC, I’d consider this a great deal—either cheap or at least standard pricing for the quality you get.\n\nThe food presentation is top-tier, making every dish not just delicious but visually stunning. You’re getting beautifully plated food that looks high-end—without the crazy price tag. And let’s talk about the taste—it’s fantastic, definitely above average compared to most places.\n\nThe staff is insanely friendly and attentive, always making sure you're well taken care of. Their professionalism and well-dressed appearance add to the restaurant’s high-end feel—without the high-end price tag.\n\nThe atmosphere is really something special, making it an ideal spot for both casual outings and special occasions. It’s elevated yet welcoming, which is rare to find at this price point.\n\nAnd if you're still on the fence—just look at my photos! You know you want it. Doesn't that look delicious? 😆\n\nDefinitely recommend a visit if you’re in NYC—100% worth it!"
