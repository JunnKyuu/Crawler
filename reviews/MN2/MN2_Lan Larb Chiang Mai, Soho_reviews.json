Don't skip the Moo Ping skewers either—they were ridiculously juicy and full of flavor.\n​I ordered the Lychee Thai Tea and found it a bit unusual without the traditional milk, but that's a minor detail compared to the excellent food. Service was top-notch; a special thank you to our server, Tonya, and the whole Sunday team who kept things running smoothly.\n​Highly recommend giving this place a visit!"

The Nam Prik Noom tasted wonderfully authentic while the Sai Aua was flavorful but a bit too spicy for us.\n\nService here was just as memorable as the food. The staff were warm, welcoming, and attentive. A special mention goes to Gig, our lovely waitress, who not only made excellent menu recommendations but also shared tips for local attractions."

The Khao Soi is rich and comforting, the crispy pork belly stir-fry is done just right, and the red curry pork hits the spot.

Flavors were delicious, very authentic and a tribute to Northern Thai cuisine. They had an amazing sticky rice, it came in cute little baskets.

Would need to be convinced strongly to ever try anything here again.\n\nThe short rib was bad and came with a measly amount of sticky rice. The tom yum soup was way too sweet.

The food is excellent—truly the best and most authentic Northern Thai cuisine. The service is great, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. I highly recommend this place, especially if you’ve ever been to Chiang Mai, Thailand, because the flavors make it feel like a Chiang Mai kitchen has been brought right to the heart of Soho, New York City!"

The jim jaew could have used a bit more toasted rice and Hung Lay curry a bit more fish sauce but I am fully aware that dominant demographic served is not Thai. The host did offer me fish sauce before I even asked — very attentive service.\n\nThe menu offered a wide array of northern dishes, which was a pleasant change from the typical offerings for the western palette.\n\nFantastic job to the staff working on Thursday! I was taken care of, had a nice meal, and left satisfied and satiated. Will be back!"

I was excited because it was my first time eating Thai food. I am so glad I came here! My server Greenie was sweet, kind, and professional. She has such a bright smile and delivered perfect service. Greenie was calm, patient, and knowledgeable about the entrées on the menu and seafood options, which was very helpful for when we were ordering our food. She also came to check up on us while we were eating to ask about the food and if we needed anything else. The food was delicious and I enjoyed it, especially the coconut shrimps. I would definitely recommend this place to family, friends, and other people who want to try Thai food or love Thai food. Please request for server Greenie! Amazing 5-star service at this restaurant!"

            "text": "Came here on a whim because we were craving Asian with some kicks and we’re close by.  The space is small but the menu is super extensive and comprehensive. We opted for something simple (because we were just starving) but I would urge you to be more adventurous.\n\nApp:\nFried calamari with ginger avocado sauce\nSimple, but pretty different with the ginger avocado sauce. It is smooth with a spicy kick, added to the hot and crispy fried calamari.\n\nEntree:\nKanom Jean Nham Ngiaw\nFermented rice noodle topped with pig cracklings/pork rinds, bean sprout, and cabbage. Honestly it tasted exactly as it said on the menu. Sweet, sour, salty, though sweet is “turned up to 11”. The thin rice noodles they use have this intrinsic texture that to me lacks toothfulness so I am not a fan. And I don’t like the texture of the rinds after they soak up the liquid and because sweet and mushy. This is what my friend had and she didn’t finish. It isn’t a bad dish, it is just so that great for us on that day.\n\nCrab meat fried rice\nWith lumped crab meat, egg, and scallion. This is actually the favorite of us two. Somehow they managed to have a fantastic “wok hei” combined with a umami yet still citrusy taste to their flavor. It is quite addictive to have a spoonful of sweet crab + umami egg + chewy-bouncy rice + herby scallion.\n\nI am intrigued by this restaurant and I feel I want to explore more of their menu options next times I come around. If they can do the simple dishes justice, then I hope they excel on other complex ones too."

Especially Malee who couldn't be more helpful and patient in assisting us in planning our dishes - taking care of everyone's food sensitivities, being real with us about spice levels - she was spot on in figuring out what we'd love. Whatever you choose to eat - you seemly can't go wrong. Everything was great. Also whatever nostalgia playlist they had on during our lunch was so fun (and not too loud.)

It was my first time here, I ordered whatever I recognized in hopes that it would taste somewhat similar to my moms cooking. Needless to say, it surpassed my expectations. For one, I ordered the Curry Pastry, I am usually disappointed by these when ordering in other restaurants or even in Thailand, but these ones were even filled with Mozzarella and tasted so so good! The second thing I ordered was Tom Kha Gai, so creamy with so much flavour. Also, the Thai Iced Tea had me very satisfied.\nThe staff were very nice, and even speak thai. The restaurant itself has a cool casual speak-easy vibe to it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting authentic Thai Food in the middle of SoHo!\nThank you Team Lan Larb for this tasteful experience, hope to see you again soon!"
