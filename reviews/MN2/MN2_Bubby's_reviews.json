            "text": "Terrible experience and poor service. We waited for over an hour, and my friend waited for almost two hours. If the restaurant only prioritizes reservations, they should just say they’re fully booked instead of letting people stand there waiting forever.\n\nWhen it was finally supposed to be our turn, the staff kept pressuring us to sit outside, even though we had already waited so long. One server told us, “You’re next,” but then said, “Oh, a reservation just arrived,” and pushed us back again. Completely unprofessional and disrespectful.\n\nAnd after all that waiting, the food was so disappointing. We thought it would be really good, but it was way below expectations — the fries tasted like leftovers, and the pancakes felt like something homemade, not restaurant quality at all.\n\nOverall, disorganized system, poor service, and underwhelming food. Definitely not worth the wait or the hype."

We thought the pancakes would be light and fluffy, sadly they were heavy and a little tough 😔 I mentioned to the wait staff that I don't normally like home style fries unless they are crispy, they said their crispy is charred but soft inside, I said that's perfect. What I received was a mushy mix of soggy potatoes and onions.. unappetizing. The saving grace were the eggs,and the biscuits. We ordered both scrambled and overeasy, both were done perfectly in my opinion. And the biscuits .. wow .. I could have had those with the eggs and the pork sausage (or bacon) and that would have been a wonderful combo. Would we come again? Maybe. There are soo many other options, probably not."

Service was super quick and efficient, especially given there were 13 of us in total.\n\nAll our family were so complimentary on everything and we all managed to leave personalised notes on the wall, which was a lovely touch.

Service was great, very friendly and responsive.\n\nI got the Hibiscus Iced Tea - server gave me extra simple syrup on the side if I wanted it sweeter.\nThe Chicken and Pancakes were PHENOMENAL. The chicken was piping hot and crispy, perfectly seasoned and a generous portion. The pancakes were thick but still light. The butter and syrup provided allowed me to customise to my preference.\nI broke up the rosemary stick over the pancakes and omg I am totally putting rosemary on my pancakes from now on, it was next level delicious.\n\nThe vibes are great, the staff are all friendly and smiley and the food is perfection. 10/10."

            "text": "went to Bubby’s for breakfast, and although it was packed with about a 45-minute wait, it was absolutely worth it. The atmosphere was lively and cozy, the kind of bustling New York breakfast spot that makes you feel like you’re part of something special.\nI ordered the homemade home fries, which came Southern-style with sautéed onions and peppers. They were perfectly seasoned and had that crispy, golden edge that’s hard to get just right.\nThe highlight, though, was the fried chicken and pancakes served with bourbon maple syrup. The pancakes were fluffy and rich, with a twist, there’s sour cream in the batter, which gives them a subtle tang and an extra tender texture. It’s a small detail that makes a big difference.\nI also sampled the cheese grits, and they were creamy, comforting, and full of flavor, a perfect side to round out the meal.\nOverall, Bubby’s delivered a fantastic Southern-inspired breakfast experience right in the heart of NYC. If you don’t mind the wait, it’s a must visit spot for a hearty and memorable brunch."

The food was another story. Overrated sums it up. The pancakes described as fluffy were not at all. I do not know what they use to make their pancakes but my guess is they used too much baking soda as they were dense and had a notably odd taste. The coffee was also odd tasting and I could only drink a few sips. The best item was their cream on the pancakes. It was light and delicious and the only thing that was completely eaten."

The flavor on them was good but the actual pancakes themselves were super thick and doughy (not my personal taste). With the Bubby's breakfast, the eggs were severely under seasoned, the toast was burnt and only toasted on one side. The potatoes and the bacon were good though. It was decently expensive for breakfast food especially, and I wouldn't go back."

We’d only been sitting there for maybe 30 minutes when someone came over to ask if we wanted anything else — when we said no, they immediately brought the bill and said, “Okay, then here you go.” The place itself looks nice, but the food was so bad that I’d never go back.

Also, the fishy taste of butter, rather than the flavor of butter, envelops the tip of the nose.  Even though I had a cold, it smelled fishy.  Without the berries and sauce as toppings, it would have been difficult to eat an entire pancake.  The berry sauce wasn't enough, so I had the rest of the pancakes left over.  The chicken came with fried breast meat along with the legs, and I was satisfied as it was reasonably soft and not dry.  The biscuits provided on the side were buttery, light, and tasted better than I expected!  There was no special service or friendliness from the server during the meal, but when the waiter handed over the bill, the waiter dialed 22% in advance and said to me, “All you just  sign please here!”  I was so embarrassed that I checked and found that the receipt he gave me was 22% of the price, including tax.  These days, there seem to be a lot of restaurants in New York that include tax and calculate tips on receipts, so it's essential to check!\n\n일행이 팬케잌이 먹고싶다고 해서 방문했으나 소스없이도 맛있는 팬케잌이 진짜 맛있는 팬케잌이라고 생각하는 나에게는 소스없이 먹기 힘든 밀가루맛이 나는 다소 드라이한 텍스쳐에서 한번 실망했다. 토핑으로 올라간 바나나는 설익은 바나나맛이 나서 좋아하는 맛은 아니었기에 한개의 팬케잌만 겨우 먹었다. 밀가루맛과 함께 버터의 비린 맛이 코끝을 감싸서 소스로 중화시켜야만 했기 때문이다. 치킨은 나름 괜찮았다. 사이드로 함께 제공되는 비스킷은 버터향이 강하게 나지 않음에도 겉바속촉으로 적당히 폭신하고 생각보다 맛있었다. 개인적으론 팬케잌보다 맛있었다. 점심에 방문한 우리에게 웨이터가 계산서를 내밀 때 22%를 미리 누르고 사인만 하면 된다고 해서 아시안을 호구로 보는 느낌이 들어서 대단히 불쾌했다!!!  그마저도 계산서에는 Tax를 포함한 가격에서의 22%라니! Tax포함한 가격에 팁을 책정해 계산을 하게 하는 레스토랑들이 많아졌다는 느낌이 든다. 레스토랑 방문시 반드시 확인 후 여러분의 돈을 낭비하지 않도록 하시길 바랍니다."

Pancake flight was fluffy and fresh, especially the berries and nutella. Their mugs and merchandise make the cutest little souvenir to bring back home. And the photo booth is a cherry on top. Would return 100% if I go back!"

Despite the bigger portion size, it wasn’t too much and not too sweet which was great! My friends enjoyed the breakfast and banana pancakes.\n\nIt took a while to be seated despite having booked in advance. However, this was made up by incredibly fast service. Our food came before our drinks! I don’t think I’ve ever been served so quickly.\n\nThe restaurant was very busy so maybe not one for people looking for a quieter breakfast spot.\n\nIt is expensive in comparison to a similar meal in the UK but I would say it’s worth a visit. I wish I could get pancakes like this in Scotland ☺️"

We went for breakfast on a weekday—six of us—and even though it was packed, we got in with a reservation. I highly recommend booking ahead because it does get busy. The vibe is super cozy, relaxed but full of life, and the service was top-notch from the moment we walked in.\n\nThe food was amazing. I had the Bubby’s Special with home fries, bacon, eggs any style, and toast. Everything came out hot and with that homemade flavor that just hits right. My wife had the special breakfast with a pancake topped with blueberry compost, eggs, and bacon, and I have to say: that bacon and blueberry compost were next-level—truly unforgettable flavors. My brother-in-law ordered the chicken & pancakes and the chicken was crispy but not greasy at all, which was a great surprise. And the pancakes overall were super fluffy, just the way they should be.\n\nA memorable breakfast right in the heart of NY. Definitely one of those spots that’s worth the hype."

I got mine with this blueberry compote that was top notch, they have a few other flavors available as well. The food came out scarily quickly (less than five minutes after being ordered), but it was tasty and fresh, so kudos to them for serving up a breakfast quick enough to make sure you can still make it to your office on time.\n\nIf you come here early in the morning you won't have a problem getting a table. But be warned that this place gets busy quick.\n\nThe one downside is that Bubby's is pretty pricey spot for a breakfast joint. If you wanna cut down costs, skip the coffee, which I believe came to about $5 a cup."

We got the Turkey BALT with fries, cheese grits, and two Shirley Temples. The sandwich had very fresh ingredients and tasted great. The fries were crunchy and very salty, which my wife and I loved. The cheese grits were good as well. It was my first time trying grits so I can’t give a thorough review on that. I wasn’t a huge fan of the Shirley Temples because they had a flavor that I wasn’t used to in them (it tasted like a strong orange flavor). The staff was very friendly. Definitely recommend!!"
