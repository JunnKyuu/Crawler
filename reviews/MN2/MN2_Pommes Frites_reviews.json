The only question when you walk in is what sauce do I want with my frites and let me tell you it is not an easy one. Luckily with the amount of frites, even a small, you can pick 2 or 3 sauces and still get a good feel for all of them. I went with the Roasted Garlic Aioli. And in case you are wondering the holes in the tables are where you put the frites cones."

            "text": "I have been running a traditional Belgian frituur “Oma’s Frit” for 15 years 🇧🇪. I walked in here out of pure curiosity, because Belgian fries are not just food — they’re a network of tradition and perfection, built over generations.\nThe secret to real Belgian fries lies in the quality and variety of the potatoes, the type of fat used, and precise control of temperature and frying time. Even how many potatoes are added to the fryer at once makes a difference: if you add too many, the temperature suddenly drops, which immediately affects the texture.\nA powerful fryer, the right fat, and especially the double-frying method with correct temperatures and timings are absolutely crucial.\nIn Belgium, potatoes are delivered fresh every day, and we mostly use Bintje potatoes because of their unique flavor and structure. Occasionally we switch to Agria, but nothing truly compares to good Bintjes.\nWith all that in mind, I was curious to give this place a try. I walked in… and honestly, I walked back out rather quickly. The bar for fries in Belgium is simply very high, and what I saw here didn’t reach that level.\n\nThis is not meant as negative criticism, just an honest observation: real fries… that’s something truly Belgian. 🇧🇪🍟"

            "text": "Pommes Frites on MacDougal is one of those spots that just makes you happy the moment you walk in. It’s simple, it’s casual, and it’s all about the fries. Belgian fries aren’t just regular fries they’re twice fried, which makes them extra crisp on the outside while staying soft and fluffy inside. The tradition goes back centuries in Belgium, where fried potatoes became a staple street food and part of everyday life. Unlike the skinny fast-food style “French fries,” these are hearty, golden, and meant to be savored slowly, usually in a paper cone with sauce dripping down the sides.\n\nThe menu here is heaven for anyone who loves dipping sauces. There are so many to choose from that it almost feels like its own adventure just picking one. This time I went with the Aji Verde, a Peruvian green sauce that was creamy, tangy, and had a nice spicy kick from the chili peppers. The cilantro and feta gave it that fresh but bold balance that paired perfectly with the fries. Honestly, it turned a simple cone of potatoes into something way more exciting.\n\nThe space itself has a fun, cozy vibe wooden walls, casual seating, and the kind of atmosphere where you can just hang out with friends or grab a quick snack before heading somewhere else in the Village. The fries come out piping hot and feel like the kind of treat you could eat on their own or with a side of poutine if you’re extra hungry. I was already stuffed from earlier, so I kept it simple this time, but that’s the beauty of Pommes Frites, you can go small or go big depending on your mood.\n\nIt’s the kind of place that reminds you why Belgian fries have their own culture and reputation crispy, fluffy, generous, and best with sauce running down your fingers. I’ll definitely be back to try more flavors and maybe finally get the poutine everyone raves about."

They definitely live up to the hype when it comes to flavor and texture.\n\nHowever, the customer service left a lot to be desired. The male employee working the counter at that time showed no personality and came across as borderline rude. There was no greeting, no eye contact, and no effort to make us feel welcomed or appreciated. It was a surprisingly cold interaction that took away from an otherwise enjoyable food experience.\n\nGreat fries, but hospitality matters—and unfortunately, it was missing during our visit."

Great for a quick, delicious snack, and they’re open late—until midnight on weekdays and 2 AM on weekends—so perfect for late-night cravings!"

We were on a mission to try their poutine, and we were not disappointed. My friend agreed it tasted like the real deal, and it was a great introduction to authentic poutine for me.\n\nLocated near Washington Square Park, Pommes Frites is as a beloved East Village staple and has a rich history of serving up authentic Belgian-style fries to both locals and tourists. The fries are made fresh, and the service is always friendly. This tiny nook should feature on any must-do food list for NYC. The space combines old-world ambience and decor with an upbeat pop soundtrack (mostly Dua Lipa during my last visit).\n\nThey’ve also expanded their menu to include fresh smoothies, which is a great addition to balance out the fries and poutine. This time, I tried their Poutine Special, topped with wild mushrooms, roasted garlic, cherry tomatoes, and fresh herbs. Even the regular portion is generous, so if you’re dining solo, be prepared to possibly take some home. Most people swear by their double truffle frites, and love experimenting with the wide array of sauces and toppings they offer here. Whatever you decide, you can’t go wrong!\n\nFor anyone looking for a satisfying and delicious comfort food experience, Pommes Frites is a must-visit. The combination of simple base menu options, quality ingredients, unique topping- and flavor- combinations, a storied past, and a relaxed atmosphere makes this a standout spot in the city."

They didn't feel like anything you couldn't whip up yourself and often you couldn't taste some of the ingredients they were supposed to have in them. They also were overly expensive for how much you get and their quality.\n\nThe atmosphere was fun but cramped, dark, and not the most comfortable.

The mushroom and pesto flavors were subtle, and only notable when trying to taste for it. Deeply disappointing\n\nThe fries and atmosphere of the place were as hoped for, but if I just wanted fries I wouldn't have gone here."

The place has a rustic ambiance while the vibes are perfect for the nearby NYU students\n\nI ordered truffle fries with mushroom sauce. I went for the mini size but it was good enough for 2 people. The fries were really long and thick and way different than I ever had. The staff was happy to have me try some of the sauces before choosing one. The fries are topped with Parmesan cheese whereas took the sauce on side. I really loved the mushroom sauce as I thought it was unique.\n\nOverall a great experience!"

Maybe we didn't get the good ones but TLC, wild mushroom didn't have the flavors their names suggest. Curry ketchup especial was okay but honestly the ketchup is what elevates this over the other two sauces. We found that we mostly reached for plain ol' ketchup."

The Frites are delicious, but could definitely do with a bit more salt and some chili powder. Some of the sauses do contain fish and/or eggs. So don't assume anything. But they have an allergy guide with them. So feel free to ask to look at it first before selecting. I also think 3 sauces are a lot for a regular sized fries. If you are also taking the free ketchup, I would stick to just 1-2 sauces."
