The Shanghainese food was incredibly tasty, reminiscent of the dishes I enjoyed in Shanghai and a signature dish I had in Hong Kong. The ambiance was clean and tidy, which added to the overall experience. One of the best features was that the dumplings 小籠包， 酸辣湯were made to order, resulting in them being fresh and juicy, definitely a must-try. Overall, this restaurant is good for finding authentic Shanghainese cuisine, and fit for business casual dinning."

I enjoyed how it was right off the street, but it was quiet inside. There was a bathroom which was clean, but the steps to get there are a little steep for those with mobility issues. Personally, one of my favorite things was the boba tea I got because in my opinion they make it better than some other places I tried in the same area.

We knew it’s the right place to come. The menu was pretty good. Almost everything you need. And not the whole pages of the junky American Chinese food. So we chose to have some dumplings, veggies, spicy meat and soup. The original plan was to order two meat dishes but the waitress stopped us and advised their food size was aggressively big. And we found out what she said was right. We barely finished the food. All of the food was super delicious! Very satisfying!!!

We had heard several other restaurants were also great but Supreme seemed big enough to accommodate our large party size of 11. They have a big table in the back that seats about 10 but we were able to stuff 11 around it.\n\nAll of us were so happy with the food! This is the way good Chinese food is supposed to be. The quality was so much better than anything we've ever had in Florida, they aren't even worth comparing. We had a lot of food, but the highlights included: the crab & pork soup dumplings, beef lo mein, crispy duck, sesame chicken, garlic eggplant, wuxi style ribs, and the fried chicken wings. Yes, all of those were highlights!\n\nBeer selection includes only TsingTao and Sapporo. Would be a cool upgrade if they brought in some Chinese beer not available in the US like Snow or Yanjing. Service was very fast and attentive. They didn't get anything wrong in our huge order other than bringing us an extra plate of soup dumplings, which ended up being a blessing because we definitely needed more.\n\nOverall, fantastic experience! I highly recommend Supreme. This would be a regular spot for me if I lived in the city.\n\nPro tip: We went on a Saturday at 11:30 and it was very easy to get a table."

Is it the thinnest like Din Tai Fung (only on the West Coast)? No but, pretty thin. The fried buns were bao-like (bready) with a crisp bottom - it could have used more filling but still yummy. The scallions pancakes were good. Prices are reasonable. Water was served & filled without me asking. We went around 8pm on a Wednesday and there were plenty of tables.\n\nEdit: went back again, this time to try a few more items, such as Szechuan dumplings (spicy sesame sauce). Boiled pork dumplings. These were ok but will not be ordering again.\n\n12/23 Back again. Really thin skin for the soup dumplings. The scallion pancakes were deep fried but really light and fluffy inside.\n\n12/24/23. Another visit for the soup dumplings! Also had the beef rice cakes (nian gao). The taste is similar to my dad’s (he’s from Shanghai) but the nian gao were fresh and super tender! A little under salted but rather that than too salty (I tend to like my food salty)."

The salt & pepper pork is over cooked, dry, and flavorless; the Shanghai Fried Rice has become a joke; The bean curd and soy beans with preserved vegetables is sloppy. Honestly, it's hard to believe that this place has a strong following.\n\nThe restaurant itself needs a facelift and it looks like the floors have not been mopped in weeks.\n\nThe service is still friendly and attentive, but the kitchen is a mess (figuratively)\n\nLastly, it's cash only, which would be fine if the food was worth it, but it's not.

            "text": "We came here for dinner and the service was really attentive.\n\nWhat we got: Wonton soup, Scallion Pancake with aromatic beef, Sweet sour fish and Pork Soup Dumplings.\n\nWho to bring: The menu selection was really simple dishes and small portioned, not a place for large gatherings and that I can bring my family to for a 9-course dinner.  Ideal for parties of 4 or less for a casual dinner.\n\nVibes: The ambiance had a cheesy DIY vibe with multicolored neon lights ceiling mounted beneath translucent plastic screens, Chinese porcelain figurines on a shelf loaded with dollar bills.  A glass shelf fronting the stairs to the bathroom with more porcelain figurines. There was no background music playing, but it felt like a karaoke bar with the neon lights.\nAlong a wall, the wooden booth seating was constantly filled for the hour we dined there.  On a long ledge sat scantly placed vases of tiny indoor plants at each booth.  A single wall where we sat had an asian-influenced wall paper that was adhered to the wall with strips of clear packing tape.  The ambiance was definitely a highlight, mainly to wonder where the inspiration was drawn from and what kind of creative team designed and executed this interior?\n\nFood: The Wonton soup was made of white shanghai wrappers, and I am used to the hong kong style wontons that are yellow from containing egg in the wrapper. But the soup was possibly literally warm steamy water and some broth powder in a dull red, over-scoured plastic bowl; not the kind of plating that reads appetizing and enticing.\n\nScallion pancake with aromatic beef: The paper menu did not have any photos ordering dishes came as a guess. The pancake was crispy and deliciously filled with julienned cucumbers and tender braised aromatic beef.  My guess to aromatic means five-spice, sugar and soy sauce.\n\nSweet sour fish was delicious.  The battered fish, crispy while smothered in sauce.\n\nRice. While even simple plain white rice can be bad sometimes, this place served well steamed rice in bowls that was nicely mounded on the top and perfectly sticky enough to hold on the chopstick; fragrant enough to know it wasn't that cheap rice that some restaurants, within walking distance, would bury in the bottom of your dish.\n\nService: The neighboring tables ordered different dishes to my interest, particularly a dish with three stuffed beef meatballs the size of a fist for $21 and change.  The waitress, when I asked her about the price, went to look it up and hollered the price to me 10 feet away, followed with asking if I wanted to order it.  I really appreciate the sense of homeliness this waitress brought, just like talking to my mother-in-law.\n\nOverall the experience was great. Make sure to dine with good company so you can thoroughly enjoy Supreme."

The scallion pancake was good with the sauce and the pork buns were warm and sweet. The service was pretty good as well. Just a good note is they don't take credit, but debit so either have cash or debit prepared."

But thats about it.\n\nThe noodles softer than it should be, soup dumplings shouldn’t be even called like that. General Tao Chicken sad and moistery, two much of sugar and not much chicken.\n\nUsed to be great place. But not anymore."

The chicken lo mein was amazing as well. All of the portions were great for the price. I really recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic chinese food! Will definitely be coming back! Service was good, food came quick. Lunchtime wasn’t busy when I went. Total was about $35 before tips."
