Google rates the food 10-20$ per person which is technically correct, but if you add their mediocre, dry rice they add an extra 10$ per bowl. I wish they’d told our party before ordering rice because typically a side of rice is under 5$; 10$ is just far too expensive for the quality. The food looked appetizing but was bland for taste; my party didn’t enjoy it at all. If you come as a group be prepared to Zelle or Venmo, they do not split checks and did not tell us before we ordered. It would have been better if they had also told us this beforehand because it caused trouble while paying. Our food also came out staggered and at worst late- While my party was finishing their meal, my food finally came. Overall it was perfectly mediocre food, but I would not come back to eat here again."

If not for the loud people talking next to me, it would truly be Zen - the music was very relaxing and the lights were dim.\n\nI had the dumplings and the Shanghai Seitan. Portions were decently sized but I was disappointed to find out that the main dish didn’t come with rice so I had to order that separately. I don’t think I’ve ever been to an Asian restaurant where the dish didn’t come with a side lol.\n\nJust a heads up, if you are a mushroom lover like me, don’t order the Shanghai Seitan, order the Oyster mushrooms with Chinese broccoli down the menu instead - they’re basically the same dish but one has seitan, and I only got two pathetic little pieces of mushrooms buried at the bottom under all the seitan and Chinese broccoli lol. The seitan was way too dry for my taste but it may be because I’m not used to eating fried foods.\n\nI will definitely give this place another shot. Overall I enjoyed it as the food wasn’t overly salty or overly oily. Ginger Root on the Upper East Side is still my favorite spot for pan Asian food, but I think Go Zen will be alright for when I don’t have the time to go all the way up there.\n\nUPDATE: Apparently this place is under new name and management now and apparently not 100% vegan anymore? Eww. The animals out there are only like 49% dead now, thanks guys!"

I will say that there Pad Thai is either the best or one of the best Pad Thais I have ever eaten whether it be vegan or not. The same goes for the cheesecake.\n\nPrices are reasonable about 13 per person, just with entrees. Keep in mind their dishes are made to be shared.\n\nThe reason why I love their food so much is that the chef doesn’t cheat. The chef doesn’t use a huge amount of salt or sugar or oil to make you love the dish. The balance of flavors is blended just right so that you are hitting all the notes. For example, the cheesecake has an extremely creamy body that is sweet, but not too sweet. The raspberry on top gives it a little extra kick, while the decorative cream in the back  is not so much decorative, but a fundamental element to the whole dish.\n\nHonestly, I think some people don’t go in because it is not crowded inside. In my opinion, you should just take that as getting to eat some of the best food without the wait."
