Crispy skin—as it should be—and meaty, not full of bones like so many other canto bbqs.\n\nThey took a while to get around to me sometimes and didn’t give me sauce w my takeout duck order, but otherwise, quick service and gave me sauce when I asked.\n\nCan’t wait to come back here to try their other food and get more duck! Standard affordable Chinatown prices :)"

We tried duck for the first time and wow I was blown away. All of the food was delicious we ordered shrimp and steak fried rice, chicken and broccoli, mixed vegetables, lomein and duck. Our bill was only $80 (very reasonable). Our server was the only one on the floor, it was dinner time and was mighty busy. As a previous server, I understand how crazy it can be.

The marinade for the pig was just delicious and everything felt cooked to perfection. The silk tofu used in the ma po was great, and everything felt very flavorful.
