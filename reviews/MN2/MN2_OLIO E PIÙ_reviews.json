Real Italian food lovers be warmed..\nthe service is nice and the decor is very cosy though."

            "text": "4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nA fantastic Italian spot with great vibes\n\nA wonderful place for brunch in New York! We had a really great experience overall.\n\nMy wife was personally delighted with the French Toast—she said it was one of the best she's ever had: perfectly custardy with a delicious caramelized crust and not overly sweet. Highly recommend it!\n\nI had the Eggs Benedict—a very high-quality dish. The hollandaise sauce was perfect, and the eggs were poached just right. I'm only giving four stars because, for my personal preference and considering the price point, the portion felt a little light.\n\nOverall, Olio e Più is exactly what you look for in this neighborhood: authentic Italian flair (even during brunch), great wine, a buzzing and lively atmosphere, and excellent service. The only thing to keep in mind is that it's quite expensive, even by NYC standards. But for the quality, service, and prime location, it feels mostly justified."

Das Ambiente ist lebendig, voller Energie und erinnert sofort an kleine Trattorien in Italien. Die Speisekarte bietet alles, was man sich von authentischer italienischer Küche wünscht: frische Pasta, knusprige Pizza aus dem Steinofen, cremige Risotti und eine große Auswahl an italienischen Weinen.\n\nWir bestellten Burrata als Vorspeise, Tagliatelle mit Trüffel und eine klassische Pizza Margherita. Jedes Gericht war perfekt zubereitet, aromatisch und mit viel Liebe zum Detail serviert. Besonders die Pasta war ein echtes Highlight – hausgemacht, al dente und mit einem intensiven Geschmack, wie man ihn sonst nur in Rom oder Florenz findet.\n\nDas Personal war herzlich und professionell, was den Abend noch schöner gemacht hat. Als Dessert rundete ein Tiramisu in bester italienischer Tradition das Erlebnis ab.\n\nMein Tipp: Am besten rechtzeitig reservieren, da Olio e Più zu den beliebtesten Restaurants im Village gehört. Wer draußen sitzt, genießt zusätzlich das besondere Flair des Viertels und erlebt New York von seiner schönsten Seite.\n\nFür alle, die italienisches Essen lieben, ist Olio e Più ein echtes Must-Visit in Manhattan – ein kulinarisches Stück Italien im Herzen der Stadt."

            "text": "Era da un po’ di tempo che desideravo provare “Olio e Più”, ristorante italiano nel Greenwich Village. Ci sono stato per un brunch domenicale. Voglio partire dalle note positive. Personale di sala molto attento e disponibile. All’arrivo l’attesa per accomodarsi, premetto che avevo prenotato, e per ordinare è stata quasi nulla nonostante l’elevata affluenza. Apprezzato l’omaggio di pane, olio e olive. Passando alle note negative, ho purtroppo sperimentato un vero e proprio disastro culinario. Non so se ciò si attribuibile a errori in cucina, mi auguro per loro, o a scelte di menù da rivedere totalmente. Per iniziare ho preso delle uova alla Benedict (Uovo Benedetto che da menù dovrebbe essere composto da focaccia bread, fonduta, bacon e naturalmente uova in camicia). Non saprei nemmeno come descrivere ciò che mi è stato servito. Cominciando dal pane, due fettine dure come la pietra che non erano di certo il focaccia bread elencato nel menù. Bacon carbonizzato, fonduta praticamente non pervenuta (a parte delle minuscole gocce quasi per caso presenti sul pane mentre ci si aspetterebbe che la fonduta fosse in quantità tale da ricoprire le uova) e uova oltre modo cotte (vedi foto). Ho voluto comunque provare anche il loro French Toast per verificare se le uova alla Benedict fossero state per caso un piccolo incidente di percorso. Anche in questo caso delusione. Porzione minuscola (una fetta di pane) tale da non giustificare il prezzo. Guarnizione di frutti di bosco striminzita e sciroppo d’acero quasi non pervenuto come la fonduta. Mi spiace dovere dare un giudizio negativo ma l’esperienza non è stata all’altezza delle mie aspettative basate sulle recensioni che avevo letto. Spero di potermi ricredere e cambiare opinione nel caso tornassi da Olio e Più."
