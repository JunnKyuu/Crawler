I love the Thai chicken rice, in which the chicken is cooked with care, tender yet chewy with the right balance. But the overall street vibe is what sets it apart. I love hearing the Thai language spoken in the back and the laughters that permeate in the space. They also serve super fast, like lightening fast!"

I ordered the steamed chicken rice and it was tender, juicy, and paired perfectly with the fragrant ginger rice and flavorful sauces. The broth on the side was light but comforting, and the portion size was just right. The place itself is small and casual, more of a quick-stop or takeout spot, but the food really stands out for its authenticity and taste. Prices are fair for the neighborhood, and service was friendly and efficient. Definitely worth trying if you’re in the area and want something satisfying and different from the usual."

I’ve traveled to Thailand, but I’ve never experienced ginger fried rice like this—it was so unique and flavorful that I couldn’t stop taking bites back to back. I received my order no more than 2 minutes after ordering, which was incredibly impressive. I’m already planning my next visit just to try the same plate again, and I’m seriously considering bringing some home after work!\n\nThe boneless fried chicken was absolutely perfect—juicy and packed with outstanding flavors that really stood out. To top it all off, the chef personally thanked me for my service and even gave me a bottle of water on the house. It’s the little things that make a big difference. I will definitely be back—this spot is worth every visit!"

Rotating between the roasted chicken with rice and the daikon (mooli) soup is the most incredible comfort food experience you will ever have for $13. If you're feeling saucy, their spicy flavour wings are both juicy and crispy, and it's coating reminds you of 'nice n spicy' flavoured nik naks. The servers are also super polite and friendly. The shop is only small, but there were stools available both times I visited."

They have high chairs next to the large glass window to look over the 3rd ave.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious. We will definitely went back here soon.\n\n——————————\n1st visit: 01/2023\n\nWe dropped by this restaurant close to the time they close. We bought Roasted Chicken over rice and a side of roasted chicken. The food was amazing. The chicken was very tender and tasty. The rice was very authentic and flavorful. We think they cooked the rice with chicken broth, which made the rice so yummy. The star of the dish was the ginger sauce. Totally recommend.\n\nThe portion was large. The set will come with Daikon soup. It is the Asian culture to have a simple soup with a heavy meal.\n\nThe staff made our food really quick and was very friendly.\n\nThe restaurant space is pretty small but very cozy and bright. The minus point was that they don’t have rest room. That was the reason we decided to have the food to go rather than sit in."

The chicken was fresh, incredibly juicy, and perfectly seasoned, with that ideal balance of crispy skin and tender meat. The rice was just as impressive—flavorful, fragrant, and cooked to perfection, making it more than just a side but a key part of the meal.\n\nWhat sets Me Chicken Rice apart is the love they put into their food. It’s evident in every bite, from the quality of the ingredients to the careful preparation. It’s a small spot, but the success they’ve achieved in mastering such a simple yet delicious dish is huge. Whether you’re a local or just passing through, Me Chicken Rice is a must-try for anyone who appreciates good, honest food."

The chicken texture is silky and tender like tofu, with almost perfect proportion of fat and lean meat. The house-made ginger sauce nicely highlights the umami of the chicken flavor. The white pepper radish chicken soup that comes with the combo is also hearty.\n\nIf you come in a group and want some variety, this well-maintained hole-in-the-wall place also  offers other authentic yet affordable dishes. No wonder why it has gained such population despite the humble interior deco. Would highly recommend everyone to try."

I loved how the rice was flavored with broth and the chicken was cooked super tenderly. Simple but delicious. Super homey spot too~ Chicken and rice cost $10-11. Definitely would come back again! Thank you :)"
