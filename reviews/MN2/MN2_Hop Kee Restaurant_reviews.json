Every soup here is delicious, and they serve it with light, crispy chips and a little side of sweet and sour sauce for dipping—it’s the perfect beginning to the meal.\n\nThen add the egg rolls. These are a must-have. The cabbage inside has the perfect crunch—never soggy or sloppy—and the flavors are balanced and satisfying.\n\nFor the main dish, go for the pork lo mein. The portion is hearty enough to feed two people, but the flavor is so good you’ll want it all for yourself. Of course, the menu is full of amazing choices, but this is a go-to favorite.\n\nI bring friends and family here every time I visit, and it’s always a hit. It also makes me smile that my ex-husband, Anthony Bourdain, visited several times—his photos are proudly displayed on the walls, adding to the restaurant’s charm and history.\n\nThis spot is truly a gem, and I can’t recommend it enough."

(난 친절하게 주문했는데) 당연히 말하는 나도 싸가지 없어지고 한국욕도 박아버리고. (다른 손님 대할때는 톤이 바뀜)\n그리고 언제부터 미국에서 2인 18프로팁 자동으로 받음? 미리 이럴려고 싸가지 없게 손님 대했나 생각듬.\n그냥 기분나쁨. 주변에 단골할 만한식당 찾아서 거기가지만 거기 가스공사 이유만 아니었으면 여기 가지도 않았음.\n요리도 형편 없어지고 주변 사람없는 식당이든 주변 유명식당이든 여기보다 훨씬 나음."
