You can pretty much get the same offerings in the other places.  HOWEVER, they carry the one thing that makes everything else significantly better.  The addition of their mango salsa heightens every bite of food.  What separates them honestly is that salsa and the staff.  A certain warmth exists when you walk into the store.  The staff behind the glass puts a lot of care into making your food and offers suggestions when stuck.  But one more important factor is the gut busting proportions they have in their bowls.  If you thought you were packing lunch tomorrow, you aren't, you're reheating the second half of this bowl of food.  And it will taste as good as it did when you first started shoveling this food into your mouth.  Very enjoyable, and will be returning."

The women working there have bad attitudes, like they don’t even want to be there. The men, on the other hand, were much friendlier. The food was okay but definitely not authentic Mexican — they’re Indian, not Mexican, so don’t expect real Mexican flavors.\n\nThey also pick and choose who they want to be nice to, mostly treating people from their same race better. Really disappointing experience overall"

I am not sure what they marinated the onions in but, I have red fingers now after touching them to top my tacos. Then I had the bowl meal, which was much better and full of flavor! I also appreciated the generous portion; however it was all cold.  Good thing I took it home, so I reheated it and it was delish. My friend had the french fries plus the toppings. She was very disappointed! They were not french fries, but roasted potatoe wedges and the portion was half the size of what I had.  I will come back but, to order home and reheat, and will stay away from their \"french fries\"."
