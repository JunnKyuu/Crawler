The pasta is cooked perfectly, sauces are rich and balanced, and the portions are generous without being over the top. The staff is friendly, our waiter Serafin was very attentive, and they made us feel like family. Cozy atmosphere, great wine selection, and truly one of the best Italian spots around. Can’t wait to go back!"

Just lettuce on a big thick piece of bread. The quality of the clams had a weird taste, everything Served was sub par.. The Service lousy, the soda lines need cleaning. Gordon Ramsey needs to visit you guys. It’s a total rip off. Most things on the menu are not available."

More graham crackers were needed for the crust and the apples were too tender. The Calamari, perfection! The salad and the meatballs were yummy. Ask for prices when making substitutions, you will be charged on top of the upcharge for pasta with any ofvthe entrée. We asked for garlic and oil instead of marinara,  $11! The bread, DELICIOUS! I wish it would have come with sauce but I saved a piece to go with my meatballs.  The waiter didn't really check on us. We got one drink and our  glasses sat empty until we had to call someone over to order something else. We were a party of 6 and our bill was about $450/with tip. We tipped $70."

Ordered with Mariana for penne Alfredo well done not Al dente.  And got Al dente cooked.\n\nI just thought they would throw the pasta in the skillet then pour Alfredo sauce and let it simmer or cook until it start to bubble up which would then be evenly coated pasta with sauce instead of having to stir it yourself.  that’s how it came penne with a sauce over it instead of it the pasta sitting in the sauce.\n\nThe onion bread is good and focaccia!\n\nI expected the food to be really good and pleasing but got disappointed with how the food really was\n\n*** if you get Alfredo Sauce PASTA MAKE SURE YOU TELL THEM NO PROSCIUTTO."

In the warmer months I enjoy eating outside on the patio. Inside, they have a pizza counter with some seating overlooking their pizza oven, but you can certainly sit in the main dining room or back room when it’s open. During my most recent visit Marisa and Andres served us and were very attentive and helpful. The only area of improvement is their music selection. I love that it’s mostly Italian, but perhaps they can choose some more lively beats."

I enjoy selecting from their little pizza assortment at the counter, which is unique to the other pizzerias in the area. The Romana stuffed slice I've been getting for over 20 years and it's still impressive. Marinara, Caprese, Zucchini slices and mini pies are all hits as well. They did away with the white clam sauce, so disappointed but I heard you  an catch it on their daily specials every now and then. Julianne Vegetables and Chicken Parmigiana entrees were delicious.\n\n1/9/25: Always a nice go to when you're seeking a quick dinner closeby. The dining room was pretty quiet when we went around 4:30. The service was up to par as usual and the food equally up to standards."

They offered a traditional menu of Italian food and many daily specials which they change often it seems and that’s great for variety.\n\nI had the baked little neck clams and they were good, the lasagna and it was delicious and also they vegetable soup which had incredibly flavor. For dessert we had the crème brûlée cheesecake which was also good.\n\nIt doesn’t seem they are very big on appearance when it comes to food but if your looking for a good spot to sit down and some good to enjoy, you won’t go wrong here."

However, our waiter was wonderful. Unfortunately she was responsible for waiting on both inside and outside customers. They needed another waiter not fair to her. Then to top the dining experience, their was a couple in the men's bathroom having a discussion or doing who knows what. I will not be returning unless I had an emergency need to eat.\nPS. it does have a beautiful decore."

I had a grandma slice which tasted good but the crust was very pale and dry which was surprising. I also sampled a regular Napolitano slice. It had a nice balanced flavor and a better crust than the grandma. Overall a good visit, but not quite as I had remembered. I think New Park nearby has a better slice, in my opinion."

Indoor and outdoor tables were clean. The ambiance gives you cozy feeling. They’re in a shopping mall so parking can feel crazy at times. This pizza is worth a first time trip and maybe a second if you’re near by. Would I take a 1hr ride to try this pizza. Absolutely not. Nothing special but it is a great pizza joint. Like many customers have stated, its very EXPENSIVE. The pizza does not justify the prize. You’re paying neighborhood premium. I think you can get a better deal at New Park Pizza that is a few minutes away(strictly Pizza experience)."

The penne vodka lacked the depth of flavor I expected from an Italian spot, and the pizza could’ve used a crispier crust. That said, it’s still a step up from places like Olive Garden, so if you’re in the area and craving Italian, it’s worth checking out—but don’t expect to be blown away."

I knew I could count on them for delicious brocoli rabe dishes and chicken parmigiana, and they held true! I am so happy I finally had a chance to bring family to try LaVilla's!
