Our waitress provided excellent service, demonstrating remarkable memory, but was responsible for multiple tables, requiring us to seek assistance from the busser. We also needed to inquire about a missing platter for the birthday girl. Ultimately, all our needs were met. The children, including the birthday girl, received complimentary ice cream. The flounder Po Boy I ordered was tasty but could have included an additional piece of fish. The restaurant's atmosphere is exceptionally relaxed and comfortable. The presence of a DJ kit in the dining area suggests an energetic ambiance on weekend evenings. This venue is ideal for birthday celebrations, and I would definitely return. The restaurant's location within a mall offers convenient and free parking."

We ordered the lunch boil special, Cajun fries, sodas, crab legs, and it was so delicious. We had an awesome time at Hook and Reel. Our server was Selena. She took the time to get our orders and even asked if we needed anything else. Very considerate with time and questions we had. When we asked for something she took a few seconds and got it for us very quick paced. Not many servers today take this time and should be commended for. Thank you Selena. You made our family lunch day special. Hook and Reel will be our go to spot in future occasions."

            "text": "I decided to check out this seafood spot called “Hook & Reel” after a friend suggested it. We were there to celebrate my oldest son’s upcoming kindergarten graduation on June 7, 2024. As we arrived, I felt a bit uncertain. I really enjoy seafood—actually, I love it—but my kids are pretty picky and typically stick to chicken nuggets and fries. I thought, well, it's dad's celebration, so I might as well treat myself to some crab legs while they play on their phones. I promised to take them to McDonald’s afterward.\n\nWhen we got inside, I did what I usually do and let the server know that my kids are autistic. It’s just important for safety and a few other reasons. She then informed me that they charge for kids, even if they weren’t going to eat anything. I asked if she could check with the manager because I really wanted to try the food. She was kind enough to ask, and the manager agreed—though he warned me that if he saw the kids eating even a little, I would be charged.\n\nSince it was happy hour, there were two menu options available. One option had mussels, shrimp, and more, while the pricier choice included crab legs. I opted for the basic one to see how it was. Just a heads up, they also have a rule that says you have to finish everything on your plate; otherwise, you’ll be charged based on the leftover weight. There were so many rules I didn’t know about before coming here that I might have passed on this recommendation altogether. And yes, that friend is still around, but I won’t be taking any more of their suggestions.\n\nWhen the food arrived, the only thing that was somewhat decent was the wings. The seafood tasted old; the shrimp was unclean, and everything else was lacking flavor. When the bill came, I was shocked to find that for two adults, I still ended up paying over $100 for happy hour. I honestly wouldn't recommend this place—the service was just okay, not great. The food was pretty terrible, and I had to trick myself into eating it because I didn’t want to get hit with a charge for wasting food. Thank goodness I only took small samples."

First thing the drinks were horrible and we were given house liquor when the ingredients clearly stated the tequila would be Teremana... the drink overall had to be made from someone who is truly not a bartender..you can just tell. The food was subpar, the hush puppies did not have crab AT ALL in it...not sure what type of fish was in it...it smelled very FISHY. The seafood boil was OVERCOOKED and I did not get the flavor and spice I requested. The waiter did fix the spice part though. The wings are baked not fried...it honestly tastes microwaved. The garlic noodles were an absolute joke...GROSS. The BATHROOM took the cake for me. The sink faucet is so GROSS..I can't believe they would allow this mold/mildew to grow to this point and what's crazy it the water runs through this omg NEVERRR AGAIN....PLEASE DO BETTER!"
