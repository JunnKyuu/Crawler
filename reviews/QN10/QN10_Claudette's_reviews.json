There is a wide variety to choose from. I’m picky with my falafel and hummus and this was very good. Hummus is nice and creamy. Falafel is fresh. Definitely want to try out more of their menu!"

My last visit though changed my experience for the better, thanks in Huge Part to Rashad. He was personable, pleasant, knowledgeable & has a good sense of humor. The new space is sooo Beautiful & I’m glad to have an experience that matches the ambiance."

We were ever so pleasantly surprised by the açaí bowls which have an in house açaí- banana blend that is better than any other I’ve tasted. They serve it from a soft serve so it’s good to go!"

From the moment you step inside, the warm ambiance and inviting decor create an atmosphere that feels both cozy and vibrant.\n\nOne of the standout features of Claudette's is their \"Build Your Own Bowl\" option, which allows you to craft a meal tailored precisely to your preferences. The variety of options available is impressive, catering to various tastes and dietary needs, making it a perfect choice for anyone looking to explore new flavors or stick to their favorites.\n\nPersonally, I can't recommend the schnitzel highly enough. Cooked in coconut oil, , it strikes a perfect balance of crispy on the outside while remaining tender and juicy on the inside. This dish alone is worth a visit, but the chance to customize your bowl with fresh toppings, grains, dips and sauces elevates the experience even further.\n\nWhether you're a fan of Middle Eastern cuisine or simply looking for a delicious meal, Claudette's delivers on all fronts. The combination of high-quality ingredients, creative options, and a welcoming atmosphere makes it a must-visit spot. If you haven't been yet, I highly recommend stopping by for a meal that will leave you craving more!"

Best coffees in Howard Beach, would definitely recommend any of the special lattes such as the cardamom rose latte, pistachio honey latte, and the halva latte it is absolutely the best! There are so many good options and all of it is delicious. I love to make bowls with the lemon pepper chicken, perfectly grilled and seasoned chicken. The overnight oats are also a great breakfast option. All the pastries are amazing, there’s not a single pastry that Claudette made that I didn’t enjoy. The app is also very helpful as it has pictures of every menu item and pre-ordering will always be my go-to. Definitely give Claudette’s a try if you haven’t, I could assure you that you won’t regret it."
