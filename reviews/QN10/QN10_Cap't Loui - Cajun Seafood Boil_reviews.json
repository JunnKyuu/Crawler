Everything tasted fresh. The real winner though is the garlic noodles. They’re buttery and garlicky in the best way, super simple but just perfect with the boil.\n\nService was solid, food came out quick, and the whole spot has a good vibe. Definitely a five-star kind of place."

I went with the medium spice, which hit that perfect balance of heat while still letting you savor all the delicious flavors.\n\nThe seafood portions are generous and fresh, and everything was cooked just right. The staff is friendly and attentive, making the experience even better. The location is clean and comfortable, with a casual, welcoming vibe. There’s limited free parking in front, which is super convenient if you get there early.\n\nOverall, Cap’t Loui delivers on flavor, quality, and service — definitely a spot I’ll be coming back to!"

It took the young lady a little while to return, but no big deal.My order was taken accurately & she was friendly. The food came out hot and tasted fresh. The season in the boil bag lacked, it was mainly oil, which I wasn’t a fan of. I still ate my meal. My problem came at the end when I received my bill. The male waiter wearing glasses returns with my paid check and taps the check and says “TIP”. My first thought is how did you figure that I wasn’t going to tip you that you needed to ask. I was appalled. I did tip and was going to but YOU DONT ASK…. If the customer wants to give they will. That was a big no no for me"

I had never had oysters before, so I didn't know what to expect.  But these tasted fresh and delicious.  Let me tell you -- the reviews recommending the garlic noodles are spot on. It complemented the shrimp boil perfectly.  Chose the Capt Loui's sauce with medium spiciness and it was definitely the right call.  Not to salty, which is what I was worried about.  My friend devoured his clam chowder in a matter of minutes, so I'm guessing he enjoyed it.\n\nThis place is super underrated.  I'll definitely be coming back!  So glad to have found a seafood place in the neighborhood."

I’ve even ordered delivery and the food quality remained high.\n\nThe servers were always polite, accommodating, and made me feel very welcomed + did I mention the food is good?!\n\nThe restaurant has the expected look of a seafood boil restaurant- food pictures on the wall, fishing gears etc music is usually moderately low and adds to the ambience\n\nFood: I typically opt for the lemon pepper fries, lobster roll, whole Dungeness crab with shrimp head on, corn & rice ( sausage too if it’s pay day lol)\n\nCurrently no happy hour at this location and no outdoor seating. Reservations can be made but I’ve never had an issue with walking in\n\nMy only feedback: the cocktail menu needs some work. The Caprisun drinks are a cool concept but the drinks are either lacking flavor, lacking alcohol or both. Other than that, looking forward to returning!"
