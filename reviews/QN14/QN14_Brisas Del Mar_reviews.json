You are ripping people off . Well you won't be ripping me off any longer.

I just looked up the prices online  and we were charged way above what was marked online. Paid $30+ for 2 orders of chicken, rice, & beans large size.\nIt’s really bad business to change the prices based on who comes in.\nIn a world in turmoil you’d think a local business would want to show some standards or at least be kind. It’s not right."

So when we left BBQ we walked past this place and said to my husband we should have gone here  he was like next time.  So we did and never regretted it.  The food is delicious and the portions is very generous 😋. The Monfongo is awesome 👌 We love this place."

I wish they would serve food for dine-in on washable dishes rather than serve everything in disposable containers with disposable silverware.
