            "text": "Following a prior unsatisfactory experience, this visit presented several challenges. Specifically, there were issues with the presence of flies, impacting the dining experience.\n\nFurthermore, the frozen strawberry daiquiri lacked the expected flavor profile, suggesting potential deviations from the established recipe. The quality of the food was inconsistent, with the rice being undercooked while the oxtail, though flavorful, was somewhat fatty.\n\nDespite the limited number of patrons, the owner's engagement was minimal, and the overall experience raises concerns about future patronage."

Asked for a side of sauce never came out until almost done with meal. Then there was a promotion for $10 for using google pay which i did and when asked even the owner couldn't tell me how it works . This was the second time with service issue . The only positive is the food was decent ."

            "text": "Last weekend, I had the pleasure of visiting Rhythms on the Rock with my family, and it was truly a delightful experience. From the moment we arrived, the vibrant atmosphere set the tone for what would be a memorable meal.\n\nWe started with the jerk chicken wings, and they were simply out of this world! Cooked to perfection, the wings were infused with a wet jerk sauce that enhanced their flavor beautifully. Each bite was a burst of deliciousness that left us wanting more.\n\nNext up was the pepper shrimp, sautéed in traditional Jamaican seasonings. The dish was a celebration of flavors, featuring scotch bonnet, shallots, garlic, and fresh thyme. It was incredibly satisfying and truly embodied the essence of island cuisine. We also enjoyed some lightly fried fish  nestled in warm tortillas, topped with crispy slaw, a creamy sauce, and a hint of lime for that perfect balance.\n\nFor a lighter option, the burrata salad was a standout. Creamy burrata served over a bed of fresh mixed greens and vine-ripened tomatoes, drizzled with olive oil and balsamic glaze – it was refreshing and delicious.\n\nWe couldn’t resist trying the grilled salmon and the tasty grilled lobster, both of which were cooked to perfection and added to the delightful experience.\n\nTo wash it all down, we enjoyed some creative cocktails. The Miami Vice, a blend of rum, pineapple juice, coconut crème, strawberry slush, and lime, was a fruity delight. The frozen watermelon mojito, made with watermelon, lime juice, white rum, seltzer, and fresh mint, was incredibly refreshing and the ideal way to complement our meal.\n\nOverall, Rhythms on the Rock exceeded our expectations with its fantastic food, vibrant atmosphere, and friendly service. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for great food!"

            "text": "Devon is a humble owner who talked to me about himself and his restaurant. Opened in February of 2025, he is doing well so far. On weekends, they have live music dining. The place is clean, the food good, and he even has a food truck to sell at the boardwalk to draw attention to his main brick and mortar. They have plenty of vegetarian options such as fish or simply no animal dishes. I had the Jerk Burger sliders, and it was deeelish. The burgers were so juicy, and sauce is one thing that usually gets refrigerated again and again, but the sauce was fresh and had no hint of refrigeration flavor. If you ever stop by Far Rockaway Beach, be sure to stop by here. There will be plenty of seating options both indoor and outdoor for you. There is also two person dining for a romantic night for you and your S.O."
