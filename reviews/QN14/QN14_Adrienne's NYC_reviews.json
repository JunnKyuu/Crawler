Everyone we dealt with including Chris, Megan, Nancy and Michael, were so helpful and made sure the night went smoothly. The loft area upstairs was perfect for our group of about 20 guests. And now to the best part…the food. Everything we had from the salad to the dessert was absolutely delicious! The arancini, Chef A’s rigatoni, skirt steak and everything else was incredible. Truly. Everyone loved it! So thank you again to everyone at Adrienne’s for making the night unforgettable. You are definitely on our restaurant rotation now."

The restaurant was closed to the public for this so we were able to utilize the entire space. From the staff to the food everything was amazing.  I can’t say enough about the staff and the owners . They were so accommodating and no detail was overlooked. Lina definitely was an all star . We were blessed with great weather and able to be inside and out. I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion."

We were told we couldn’t have a table in the atrium despite SEVERAL empty tables because it was all “reserved” even after asking again. For one and a half hours all those tables remained empty while we sat isolated in a hot boring corner. Towards the end of our meal, we saw a couple being told the same thing but when they pressed again, the host sat them in the atrium. I have not felt this level of disappointment in a long time especially because we were the only racially different people there. When we complained, the host had an attitude while she went to get the manager. The manager was kind but this experience has left a sour taste."

            "text": "TLDR: I enjoyed the appetizers [calamari + burrata garlic toast] and my \"specials\" entree [pink snapper]. But other entrees [veal milanese, oxtail agnolotti] were wayyyy too salty! Loved the atmosphere and service tho!\n\nMy party and I all thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers. I think the burrata garlic bread was the highlight of the night. The garlic butter on the bread was heavy on the salt, but it was kinda balanced out by the burrata... so im not that mad about it. The calamari was $21 which i honestly thought the portion size was quite small for that price. It was good regardless.\n\nI got the special of the night, Pink Snapper, which was on top of a creamy veggie medley [peas, leeks, peppers... + other stuff]. This was so yummy! Loved the balance between the pan fried fish and the creamy sauce. My boyfriend got the Veal Milanese which was SOOOOOO SALTY. The arugula salad was crunchy due to the crazy amount of salt on top. Originally thought the arugula had parmesean on top........ which was incorrect. All salt. I thought the veal was also extremely dry and under seasoned, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. Our friend ordered the Oxtail Agnolotti which he enjoyed the Oxtail, but again the sauce was too salty.\n\nUltimately, I enjoyed my dinner but please just go lighter on the salt!"

The Calamari and Octopus dishes are not to be missed. And the Burrata appetizer and the Ricotta bread appetizer are both phenomenal.  Every desert is off the charts and you can tell that all of the specialty drink are made with high quality ingredients. The bartender Christine is the BEST and the entire staff and owners are exceptional and always go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed. And then you have the beautiful water views and sunsets with the addition of live music for the perfect atmosphere.  It just doesn’t get any better than Adrienne’s!!!"

We had a friend flying in from out of town and, due to some last-minute logistical issues, had to change our reservation time. On a busy summer Friday when every table was booked, they still found a way to make it work for us. Their flexibility and hospitality turned what could have been a stressful night into a memorable one. It’s rare to find a place that values both great food and genuine service at this level. Can’t recommend them enough!"

After a sunny afternoon at the Rockaways, we were craving a chilled drink by the water and initially headed to Bungalow Bar—but with no parking in sight, we started driving away and stumbled upon Adrienne’s on Broad Channel Island. I’m so glad we did.\n\nAdrienne’s is a charming waterfront Italian restaurant with a lovely breeze, relaxed atmosphere, and live music (we caught a guy singing covers on guitar—such a nice touch). The menu is fantastic, and the standout for me was the lobster agnolotti. It came in a saffron and cultured butter broth that was absolute heaven—not too salty, perfectly balanced, and I’m pretty sure the pasta is made in-house.\n\nIt’s the perfect spot to wind down after the beach. Cozy, unpretentious, and delicious. Definitely adding Adrienne’s to my Queens restaurants rotation."

It was great that we had the space for the evening, so we were not rushed.\n\nWe really enjoyed all of the food.

The loft space is beautifully designed and offers a stunning view of Jamaica Bay.\n\nFrom start to finish, our experience was delightful. Chris K. owner/manager was quick to respond to my inquiries and very accommodating during the planning process. On the day of the event, the service was exceptional. The food surpassed our expectations, with generous family-style portions. I couldn't get enough of the delicious bread service, especially the olive oil dip. The Poseidon raw bar and the skirt steak were absolute hits!\n\nOverall, it was a memorable event, and I enthusiastically recommend Adrienne's restaurant as a whole, but especially their private loft space for any special occasion."

I dine out a lot and I have never been to a restaurant that not only has great food, but that also has such an accommodating, friendly, fun staff. It is so obvious that the “customer” at Adrienne’s is the most important thing to everyone who works there. You all do it right on every level! - Katie"

The private upstairs room comfortably accommodated our group of 24 and offered a beautiful view of the water. My guests were impressed not only by the setting but also by the delicious food and desserts. The service was excellent—staff were attentive to everyone’s needs. The live music was a wonderful addition and made the day even more special. Everyone had a fantastic time.\nWe also love coming on Friday nights for the DJ. Whether with new or old friends, Adrienne’s is always a great place to gather and have a good time. The menu changes, so there’s always something new to try, both in food and drinks, which keeps each visit exciting!"
