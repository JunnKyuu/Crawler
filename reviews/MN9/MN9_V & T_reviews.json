            "text": "Owner just tried to attack my mom ???\nStole our credit card, intoxicated during work hour — long post !!\n\nContext:\nJust dined in at this restaurant—I consider myself an occurring customer as I’ve ate in this establishment for years.\n\nThe servers gave us such attitude. After we ordered, my relative noticed how they would point and laugh behind (my) back. They had no manners/customer service. It felt discriminating due to our obvious age category & the way we dressed. He kept rushing us to order like he had somewhere to go (fyi, the restaurant closed in like 2 hours)\nAfter we got our check, he refused to let us pay until we said yes to giving him an 8 dollar tip (which was the minimum to him). He essentially forced us to tip him for horrible service. We said yes because we were the only people in the restaurant, at a late time—it’s not really safe so we just gave in.\nWhat we ordered: pasta $20, chicken fingers & fries ($18) + a coke ($3). Which equals to = $41\n\nWith tax it was $44.63. Ok that’s fine ?\n\nWe had the exact money for what we owed, no money for tip. Yet we didn’t allow us to pay until we gave him an $8 tip. Which is crazy because we were 2 adolescent. Tip isn’t necessary, it’s a courtesy. He didn’t deserve a tip anyways due to the lack of respect given.\n\nHe held onto my friend’s credit card until we said yes. So after we got home (less than a 5 minute walk), we told our parents what had happened. They went to go speak with the manager, my mother called me as she was doing so—and he was attempting to attack my mom. I ran as soon as I heard that, arrived to the restaurant.\n\nWe then find out they said we picked up—instead of dined in. When one of the waiters saw me that’s when he “finally knew who I was” (an excuse, trying to hide the fact they stole). I kept saying that we ate indoors, yet he told our parents we had taken out (which is an insane lie for 8 dollars). He stopped attacking my mom but by this point he was attempting to argue with me, and that waiter had left.\n\nWe didn’t feel safe enough to banter back with the server as he went up in my face—breath reeking with alcohol (we’re underage, the only people dining in—besides the owners and HIS friends). Not sure in what world was there someone being served wine.  He was certainly not in the right headspace to be in charge of money.\n\nThe owner and the waiter in black lied and said we did a pick it up—hence why we got charged. Which is a complete lie because when I got there to protect my mom after hearing the owner attempt to attack her, the waiter in black “recognized” me and said I was there. Contradicting what they’ve said.\n\nI’m truly disgusted because I’ve had wonderful memories here with family & friends, never discriminated—until now, the waiters are rude and the white lady at the cashier (not the usual lady I see, who’s more kind)\nWhen I ordered, I asked for chicken fingers & French fries while pointing at the kids menu ($12) as I lack appetite. I always order a lasagna so I wouldn’t know the difference between the kids vs regular meal. So they gave me an $18 acknowledging I wouldn’t know the difference between the two.\n\nBeing judged for not being a certain in a restaurant everyone can go to (I’ve been to this restaurant and had poc as waiters, and a nice cashier who was also poc)—so it’s funny that I was judged, based off my clothes (pants and a shirt) to a restaurant that isn’t even fancy at all.\n\nDon’t ever come here, better for you and your wallet. Our stomachs hurt after eating the food, not sure what they did."

I started with the calamari, which arrived hot and fresh—a promising sign.\n\nUnfortunately, the meat was quite thin, and the batter was overly thick, overpowering the delicate flavor of the calamari itself.\n\nAs for the pizza, it was decent but not particularly memorable. The crust had a nice texture, but the overall flavor profile didn’t stand out.\n\nWhile the experience wasn’t bad, it also didn’t wow me. If you’re in the area and craving Italian, it might be worth a visit, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for it."

After waiting for an hour and assuming the food was ready, I went to pick it up. The front desk attendant glared at me, claimed they had called (though I hadn’t received any call), and then carelessly tossed the pizza across the counter.\n\nWhen I got home, I realized it wasn’t even the right order. The pizza was cold and the wrong size, not matching what I had paid for.\n\nI’ve visited this location before without any issues, so I’m hoping this was just a glitch in the ordering system and a mix-up at pickup. However, I really hope the service improves in the future."

            "text": "We have gone to V&T for over 30 years. For many years their pizza and food was unbeatable. The problem with this restaurant is inconsistency. Sometimes the order is spot on, and sometimes the order is awful. The inconsistency started about 3 years or so ago. I suspect new family taking over and either not caring,  or not trained. Most recently, last Tuesday, 9/30/24 we ordered a pizza with a tri Colore Salad. (in the past the salad was fantastic, therefore we reordered.) Since it was the night of the VP debate, we ordered early. Around 5 ish. The pizza was the usual great pizza this time, but the salad was awful! The tri colore salad was basically a chopped up head of red cabbage or some red lettuce variation, with a few strands of lettuce. We tried to call and complain, but couldn't get through. I believe that V&T feels that since a large amount of their business is students, and students come and go, they can send out garbage without worry. This is especially easy for them since they are on the university meal plan. They have an easy gig. It is easy to rip off the students since they are busy and don't complain like us, awful long time customers. V&T, please just post that you do not want long time customers and save us the hassle of ordering from you."

But at least they heard you and got what you wanted.\n\nI got pasta e fagioli soup. Definitely not worth the $7. Didn’t taste good. We also got mozzarella sticks they were average. Not the best but not the worst. My brother said they were frozen, you can taste the after taste.\n\nThey also bring out fresh bread and butter which is delicious.\n\nI got broiled pork chops with mashed potatoes. They are 2 thick pieces with some onions and mushrooms and I think garlic on top. It was good. The mash potatoes needed some more salt and a bit of different flavoring, but was okay. My brother and sister got the pepperoni pizza. It was thin and okay."
