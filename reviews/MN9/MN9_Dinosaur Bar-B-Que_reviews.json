            "text": "Great barbecue. Good drinks. Fun atmosphere. 4 stars.\n\nUPDATE:\nSeveral years ago I left the review above. However, I returned years later for lunch. Unfortunately, certain food items on the menu has not maintained its desirability or adequate serving size.\n\nWhat stood out the most was the collard greens. The flavor is good and a little spicy (which I like); however, since the serving is finely  chopped, you're mostly eating the stems and not the collard greens. I'm sure it's 50/50, but whatever the ratio, it is not appetizing or justified when ordering collard greens.\n\nThe next food item is their pork belly. This \"appetizer-sized\" portion of a semi-thick slab of \"bacon\" cut in three pieces should not be served as an entree item with combo plates. This is not how pork belly is traditionally served and due to its thinly cut portion it tends to be over cooked. If anything, it would be best served only as a slider with pulled-pork.\n\nAvoid this item, as the portion size does not justify the cost of a $26.50 two-item combo plate. As a recommendation to the restaurant, please describe on the menu how this pork belly is prepared and served as a thin slab.\n\nIn conclusion, I spoke with two managers to convey my dissatisfaction. They kindly offered another \"slab\" of pork belly, which I declined. So, instead, they generously discounted my check by $3.90 (15%) of my order.\n\nThanks, Dinasaur Bar-B-Que!"

            "text": "Dinosaur Bar-B-Que – Harlem, NY\n\nIf you’re craving real, smoky, fall-off-the-bone BBQ in New York, this spot hits the mark! The brisket was unbelievably tender — juicy, perfectly smoked, and drenched in their tangy house sauce. Every bite melts in your mouth with that deep, slow-cooked flavor you can only get from real pit barbecue.\n\nThe whipped sweet potatoes were a surprise standout — buttery, creamy, and just the right touch of orange flavor sweetness to balance the smoky meats.\nService was impressively quick and friendly, even though the place was packed. Food came out hot and fresh in no time, which made the whole experience even better.\n\nThe vibe is classic Harlem — rustic wood, buzzing energy, and that smoky aroma drifting from the open kitchen. A great spot for hearty comfort food with zero pretense."

            "text": "2/21/25 – 7 PM\n\nWent here with my boyfriend at 7 PM and boy, it was packed! The place was bustling and since we didn’t have a reservation, we ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table. Note to self (and to anyone else thinking of going): make a reservation. Even people with reservations still had to wait a bit, so that says a lot about how busy it gets.\n\nOnce we finally sat down, it took about 30 minutes for our food to come out. We started with chicken wings (3 pc for $6.50 or 6 pc for 12.50) — I had the honey BBQ and he had the jerk glaze. For mains, my boyfriend ordered the jerk salmon with mac and cheese and Syracuse-style potatoes ($23.50). I went for the combo plate—¼ chicken and prime brisket—with whipped sweet potatoes and French fries ($26). We also had their strawberry lemonade, which was super sweet but really refreshing.\n\nOverall, the food was worth the wait. Everything was flavorful and satisfying, and I’d definitely come back—but this time with a reservation, lol."

We had brisket with two sides and the fried chicken bowl. We waited 35 min for the food so we expected it to at least be hot and both plates were cold. The brisket was gray and fatty, and the sides weren’t even the one I ordered. The chicken bowl was swimming in water from the greens. It was honestly nasty. I was shocked. The only redeeming part of dinner was the drink (because it was strong) and the corn bread, which was tasty. I know that the team is working hard but you guys have to do better."

The restaurant is super clean, with a lively yet comfortable atmosphere, and the staff are always friendly and welcoming.\n\nThe space is versatile — you can grab a seat at the bar, sit at tall tables, or settle in at regular tables. It works equally well for big groups, small gatherings, or even solo meals.\n\nAs for the food, it’s exactly what you’d hope for: smoky brisket, tender baby back ribs, pulled pork, and all the classic southern sides like coleslaw, potatoes, and fries. Portions are generous, flavors are bold, and everything is served hot and fresh.\n\nThe location is a real plus too — right next to a park by the river, making it perfect to stroll before or after your meal.\n\nIf you’re looking for authentic BBQ in NYC with great service and a prime setting, this place is hard to beat."

            "text": "The Dinosaur Bar-B-Que restaurant is an absolute amazing barbecue based chain that offers guest delicious Southern style cuisine ranging from brisket, ribs, pulled pork and wings.\n\nIn February of 2019, I brought and treated my wife and myself for dinner at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, specifically the branch based in Harlem, New York to celebrate our Happy One Year Wedding Anniversary!!! We both very much enjoyed our dining experience!!!\n\nThe staff warmly greeted us when we arrived at the restaurant and quickly provided us with a very large and comfortable dining table. Our server, Joel was very kind, superbly professional and made us feel right at home. He did a great job on explaining the menu options, the specials for the day and offered great tips on the dishes that we were likely to favor and enjoy. In addition, he perfectly noted our orders, and routinely checked in on us to make sure we were having a good time and that our needs were met. We thank Joel for his hospitality and wonderful service.\n\nUltimately my wife and I decided to order the “Family Stylin Bar-B-Que” entree which consists of 6 pieces of whole chicken, full rack of ribs, an order of pork or brisket, cornbread and 3 homemade sides. We were both in awe of the sheer quantity of food that was provided and we found every dish to be well cooked, perfectly seasoned and fabulously delicious. Everything was flawlessly made and a delight to eat!!!\n\nIf you enjoy Southern style cuisine coupled with great hospitality, you’ll definitely enjoy visiting and dining at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. My wife and I would love to thank this great restaurant for providing us an exceptional dining experience, one that we’ll cherish forever!!!"

The ribs, though tender, were dry and needed a lot of sauce to be enjoyable. The brisket also lacked flavor and was dry. The macaroni and cheese was bland and dry, not the creamy dish expected.\nThe dining experience was made worse by the service. The server was attentive at first but became unavailable after delivering the food, making it difficult to get drink refills or additional napkins.\nConsidering the inconsistencies in food quality, issues and disappointing service, a return to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is unlikely."

Unfortunately, the experience was very disappointing.\n\nThe pork ribs, which we were most looking forward to, were overcooked, dry, and drowned in sauce. Instead of enhancing the flavor, the excessive sauce just made things worse. The overall quality didn’t live up to the hype or the prices.\n\nI don’t recommend this restaurant. There are much better BBQ spots out there."

Some of the drinks and food items we asked for were not available which was a little disappointing but overall the food and drinks that we were able to get were good.\n\nMy husband had the beef ribs, Mac and cheese and creole potato salad. He says the ribs and Mac and cheese were AMAZING but there was nothing Creole about the potato salad, it was just regular potato salad, so he feels like he could’ve picked something better.\n\nI had the make your own salad with jerk salmon. The salad was a pretty big serving, however there was no jerk on the salmon and the portion of salmon was small for the amount of salad. And I needed to ask for more dressing.

            "text": "I recently dined at your restaurant and wanted to share some detailed feedback — because the potential here is huge.\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n•\tColeslaw – Unfortunately, this felt like a low-effort side. The flavor profile was very flat, almost as if it were just mayo and a touch of black pepper. A bit of acidity, crunch variety, or seasoning could make this pop.\n•\tPotato Salad – Bland overall; it didn’t stand out in any way. A little more seasoning or texture variation could go a long way.\n•\tSweet Potatoes – I appreciated the citrus note, but it didn’t quite come together. The nuts that accompanied them lacked depth of flavor and didn’t enhance the dish the way they could have.\n•\tMac and Cheese – This was the biggest disappointment. It lacked the rich, indulgent flavor and creaminess I was expecting. This dish could be a showstopper with a more robust cheese blend or seasoning.\n\nWhat Worked Well:\n•\tBrisket – Outstanding. I’d recommend this without hesitation.\n•\tWings – Bursting with flavor; really enjoyable.\n•\tPork Belly – Decent flavor, but I’d love to see this transformed into something more exciting, like a sandwich or slider. I probably wouldn’t order it again as is.\n\nOther Notes:\nThere’s a wide range of drink options, but our server didn’t highlight or recommend any, it felt rushed, which felt like a missed opportunity. A quick rundown of popular or unique drinks could really elevate the dining experience.\n\nOverall, you’ve got some great proteins and a solid foundation. With more attention to seasoning, balance, and presentation for the sides - plus a little more proactive service - this could easily be one of my go-to spots."

            "text": "Over the past couple of months, I’ve been on the hunt to satisfy my craving for perfectly fried catfish—little did I know, it was right here on the menu at Dinosaur BBQ all along! While my usual favorites are the fried green tomatoes, Brisket sliders and the BBQ Rib Sweetheart Deal (which never disappoints), I decided to switch things up, and I’m so glad I did.\n\nThe catfish dinner was nothing short of fantastic. The fish was fried to a flawless golden crisp, boasting a well-seasoned crust that delivered just the right amount of crunch with every bite. The accompanying sides complemented the dish perfectly, rounding out a truly satisfying Southern-style meal. If you’re a fan of authentic, well-executed fried catfish, I highly recommend giving this dish a try!"

            "text": "BEER: My draft beer was poured with no head: at a 45° angle, with the nozzle IN the beer.\n\nI noted this, and stirred it a bit, and then it SPILLED EVERYWHERE.\n\nThe proper pour is about half at 45°, and then the rest at 90° and you want a head on it. My experience is the result of improper staff training or just pure laziness.\n\nIf you properly release the carbonation on a beer, it will have a proper head. The head delivers the aroma and flavor. Also, with the carbonation properly released, customers are less likely to feel bloated, and are more likely to order more drinks.\n\nAt least it was cold.\n\nThe same way it spilled all over the place, is the same way it makes people feel bloated when drinking beer without a release of the CO2.\n\nFOOD: The pulled pork was dry. The brisket and St. Louis Style ribs were well seasoned.\n\nThe meat had sauce on it (which I didn’t ask for). The sauce was terrible and tastes like pure tomato and sugar. I had to wipe it off of everything. I’d rather be asked if I want sauce on my food, considering it’s also at the table. The beans were overly sweet."

The chicken tastes old, the french fries are burnt with no flavor. This is honestly the worst food I’ve eaten in a long time and we ordered a lot of food for a large family. I definitely won’t be coming back here."

            "text": "This is a great spot to visit with a group of friends. The space is large and has outdoor seating, making it a really nice spot for a casual meet-up. Just a heads-up: if you are coming on a weekend night, the place gets packed, and you will have to wait for a seat.\n\nBefore I go any further, if you are from a well-known BBQ city, you may be disappointed. I'm not saying the food is not good--just setting the expectation.\n\nOn my last visit, I came with friends for a birthday dinner. We ordered the Family Stylin' BBQ. For mains, we had pulled pork, a rack of ribs, and asked to have brisket instead of the chicken. For sides, we had mac and cheese, Syracuse-style salt potatoes, and BBQ fried rice.\n\nThe rack of ribs was a hit. They had good seasoning and a noticeable smoke ring. The pulled pork was also good; it was juicy and tender. However, the brisket was not good. Right off the bat, I was turned off by the sauce that was smothered on top. The sauce was too overpowering and tangy, working overtime to mask how dry and chewy the brisket was. I encourage you to skip the brisket. The mac and cheese were very run-of-the-mill, but the potatoes were good"

The order taker was very polite and efficient .food came out pretty fast . ( had a Virgin pina coloda, it was delicious) i ordered double Brisket, the pulled chicken with sweet mash, and mac & cheese on the side . The Brisket was good, but i definitely had better wasn't what it was hyped up to be, but still good the sweet mash was good as well as the Mac. The pulled chicken was a lil salty but ok not .(yea just ok)  all in all it was a good time ."

When I tell you that this time, to come and dine in was a completely different experience. IT WAS AMAZINGGGGGG. From the staff, the manager Samatha , to the food and accompanying my mom due to her disability. EVERYONE LOVED IT. NOW THIS IS THE DINOSAURS I REMEMBER. We will be back . My favorite is the briskets and chicken. The deviled eggs was better this time and you can tell they took their time with the food as well. KUDOS to the whole restaurant, they did their big one on this . Mark my words : I WILL BE BACK LOL"
