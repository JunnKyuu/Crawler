The owners are the same people behind the iconic Inwood Bar on Dyckman, and they brought that same Uptown soul to a whole new crowd. You get this incredible mix of Columbia University students, neighborhood locals, and true Dominican hicks it’s an energy that feels completely unique and totally authentic.\n\nThe vibe is electric. The staff is amazing, attentive, and full of personality. Every server is beautiful and knows how to make you feel welcome. Guillermo, the manager, runs the place perfectly and you can tell he takes pride in every detail.\n\nThe food is top tier. I had the oxtail and the wings, and the oxtail was honestly the best I’ve ever had anywhere. The wings were just as good. Everything was full of flavor and cooked to perfection.\n\nIf you’re into sports, this place is heaven. There must be around 50 TVs and two of them are literally the size of a movie screen. Every game, every sport, every highlight they’ve got it all.\n\nNothing like this has ever existed in this area. U-Bar is going to be a huge success. The owners did an incredible job."

It’s owned by the same people behind Inwood Bar in the Heights, so if you’re familiar with that vibe, you’ll feel right at home.\n\nThey offer an all-day happy hour on Tuesdays with a solid deal: one drink and five tacos for $20. The drinks and food were both good, and I’d definitely go back.\n\nMy only complaint is the music—they had the Latin music blasting while the American music was so low you could barely hear it. Still, the overall vibe was good and prices were reasonable. You can have a great time here for around $60."

You can tell they care about their guests and take pride in the place. Our waitress was attentive, quick, and made sure we never needed to ask for anything twice.\n\nNow let’s talk about that food—SPECTACULAR. Everything was cooked to perfection, seasoned just right, and served hot and fresh. The hookah? Bussing. Not harsh, smooth pulls, and flavors that actually hit.\n\nThe whole night flowed perfectly. No complaints, no confusion—just great people, great service, and bomb food. I’ll definitely be back. FOR SURE!

The food is completely out of this world. Taco Tuesdays is sick....omg. 5 tacos and margarita 20 bucks. 1 dollar shots. They also have a downstairs lounge and no mandatory bottle for the table. D.j. in set. This place also has a Dominican flavor on the food. Definitely would go back."

Our server, Christian, was so knowledgeable about the menu and he made sure I knew about their amazing THURSDAY LADIES NIGHT HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL! My favorite part was when I ordered something I wasn’t fond of. Christian immediately put in a new order for me, the manager  came out and checked on me, the kitchen rushed ordered a new meal, and they even gave me a shot! Whoever is responsible for the entire business model and hiring process here is excelling. U bar can have my money every Thursday 💕"

            "text": "The service is great and the atmosphere is a typical sports bar atmosphere but loud\n\nThe food, however...\n\nI've only tried the 5 dollar lunches (because who could turn down a five dollar meal in this area), so maybe these are their weakest dishes, but they are underwhelming at best.\n\nThe beef stroganoff was fine, as were the two fish dishes.\n\nI cannot recommend the chicken dishes at all. The chicken is absurdly dry. I was most surprised that the roasted chicken was dry, because it was a chicken leg. I didn't even know it was possible to overcook a chicken leg, but this was overcooked to the point that it was like chewing on cardboard.\n\nThe portions are good, but that chicken...it does not at all make me want to try any of the other food. Even at 5 dollars, not worth it."
