I ordered the kale Caesar salad, but it was inedibly salty. It tasted like I was eating a whole container of salt! I was shocked and disappointed by the excessive saltiness.\n\nThe female Spanish employee who made my food at 10:50 AM was friendly, but the guy who rang me up was extremely friendly.\n\nThere were a couple of other issues that made my experience even more frustrating. The music was extremely loud, making it difficult for me to hear the employee. I would suggest lowering the music volume so that customers can communicate effectively with the staff.\n\nAdditionally, there were no labels on any of the food, which made it impossible for me to know what I was getting. I would strongly recommend considering labels on all food items to avoid confusion and ensure a better customer experience.\n\nI've been to several other Dig locations, but this one fell far short of my expectations. The excessively salty kale Caesar, loud music, and lack of labels have ensured that I won't be returning to this location again."
