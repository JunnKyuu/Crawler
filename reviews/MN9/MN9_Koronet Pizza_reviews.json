            "text": "Koronet Pizza – The BIGGEST & BEST Slice in NYC 🍕🔥\n\nLet me tell you Koronet Pizza has the largest slices I’ve ever seen in New York City 😭🍕! Like literally, one slice could feed you for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (and I’m not exaggerating lol).\n\nI ordered a cheesy slice, and the flavor was everything perfectly crisp on the edges, soft in the middle, and loaded with that real NY pizza taste. It was so good that I’m already craving another one today.\n\nThe vibe inside feels classic New York chill, cozy, and unpretentious. It’s the kind of spot that makes you feel like you’re in on one of the city’s best-kept secrets.\n\nIf you’re in the mood for that true NYC slice experience go to Koronet Pizza. Come hungry… because these slices are next-level huge and absolutely delicious 😋🍕\n\n#KoronetPizza #NYCPizza #FoodieFinds #BiggestSliceInNYC #PizzaLovers #NYCEats #Ciciamoreats"

I just need to let them and everyone know that I had their eggplant slice and it was not just the worst thing I've had there but it was the worst thing I've ever had from a pizzeria anywhere. I wanted to whisper to the slice \"blink twice if you need help.\" Whatever they do to their eggplant and the sauce they put on top was just so acidic and strange tasting.\nFor context, a few blocks north at Trufa, the eggplant slice is their BEST slice by far. It's not really on their menu I don't think, but when I see they're serving it, I get it. I was hoping this would be that. From the first bite I knew I made a big mistake.\n\nBut otherwise, koronet has never done me wrong so this isn't a bad post just a critique to play to their strengths"

The crust on this slice is crispy on the outside, giving you that satisfying crunch with every bite, and perfectly chewy on the inside, which makes it satisfying to sink your teeth into. And the toppings were fresh, flavorful, and generously portioned.  Now, we won't go so far as to say that this is the absolute best pizza in New York - after all, the competition is pretty stiff - but we can definitely vouch for the fact that these slices are fantastic and offer great value for money. You can even share it between two people and still be left feeling completely satisfied. This pizza place is a popular haunt for Columbia University students and it's not hard to see why. If you're in the mood for a massive slice of deliciousness, this is definitely the place to be!"

            "text": "Probé la pizza jumbo de pepperoni y me dejó bastante sorprendido que el sabor fuese en general bueno, estas pizzas tienen la fama de ser las primeras jumbo desde el 81 en NY, aunque no soy seguidor del dicho \"the bigger the better\" tienen un excelente sabor costo/beneficio. La salsa sabe a jitomate y unas cuantas hierbas (la mayoría usa puré y salsas enlatadas); el pepperoni tiene más grasa que gordita nadando en cazo de carnitas , mientras come una paleta de manteca rebosada en chocolate blanco con cubierta de tocino.\nPD. Si regresaría, los precios comienzan desde $5.25 por la 'jumbo cheese pizza\", así que se convierte en una opción económica después de la 100 st. y antes de Harlem."
