            "text": "The kind of atmosphere one would imagine in a Nyc wine bar, restaurant. Has a classic euro touch feel. Attracts an eclectic patronage. Drinks and food are top notch. Keep in mind at a cost. A tad bit high for the quality, but you do get quality in return.\n\nA perfect place for a get to know me convo, or catch up with a few friends. Quiet, laid back vibe.\n\nThe owner and bartenders are very attentive and friendly. So service is a highlight.\n\nInterestingly, they project old Charlie Chaplin movies on screen by the bar area. Enjoy watching from time to time.\n\nThere aren't a lot of choices for spots like this on the UWS region. The ones that are around tend to force a brisk walk.\n\nSo if nearby, its worth dropping by. If you live close then definitely stop by."

The beet salad and tuna tartare were delicious. So was the Nero D'Avola I drank, a perfect red wine for a chilly evening. I appreciate the welcoming and friendly bar service. I am definitely going back to Elis Wine Bar solo or with friends!"

The owners Elis and Artur are not only super nice but genuinely care about their customers. They always makes sure everyone feels welcome and taken care of.

The service was lacking of everything, beyond not checking once, the server didn't do the basic, as we order octopus and a dessert  to come at the same: put a spoon on table. Of course after waiting 26 minutes, asking for a spoon result to additional wait, so I had to go get one by myself at the bar. Rush eating to be on time at our show."

Live music on weekend evenings with dancing and fun, followed by a huge napkin toss that always makes us laugh. Excellent neighborhood spot!"

The calamari and truffle fries were average, and both the pasta and chicken were just okay — I’d rate them a 5/10.\n\nHowever, the desserts were a highlight — moist, flavorful, and clearly the best part of the meal. I’m hoping that the non-happy hour offerings are more impressive, so I might consider giving them another try. Fingers crossed for a better experience next time."

Fries with my burger were soggy, and my date’s Bolognese was one of the most bland dishes I think I have ever been served in NYC. The drinks were just okay too, nothing to write home about.\n\nThe appetizers were good. Beet salad and a side of brussel sprouts.\n\nMaybe we came at an off time, we probably won’t come back but you never know.\n\nAlso one note, these prices are curiously high! There was a glass of wine on the menu that was $22, and we googled the wine and it was $37 a bottle? We eat out enough to know if you’re charging $22 a glass that better be a $60-$70 bottle retail! C’mon you’re only supposed to rip us off a little bit when it comes to drink prices 😉"

My friend went to the ER yesterday and was told it was likely due to something we ate, possibly a norovirus infection. I am still currently running a fever.\n\nRight now, I don’t have the energy to take further action, but after I recover, I will seriously consider reporting this restaurant to the health department or seeking compensation. This level of negligence is unacceptable, and I hope others will be cautious before dining here."

The fact if the matter is that if you love well-made cocktails by someone who actually cares about your weird preference on a traditional drink (ie, non-shaming you), and if you love oysters, Italian cheeses, olives, toasted-to-perfection fresh bread, and so, so much more—on top of a stylish ambiance that doesn't venture into pretentiousness—then Elis and his unicorn of a wine bar (plus proper bar & full-menu dinner!) is for you. The first time I popped in, they were still serving what are truly epic happy hour specials. As in seriously, where in all of Manhattan can you find $1 oysters that not only don't haunt your dreams, but instead, make you want to slap yourself for accepting anything less?
