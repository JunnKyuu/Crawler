If you want a savory and a sweet, go with someone who will go halvsies with you and you won’t be disappointed.\n\nThe Shakshuka was delicious and full of fresh flavor. I just wish there were more turkey chorizo for the extra $4…\n\nAnd wow I was not expecting the banana to be my favorite part of the French toast, but it was. The way it was caramelized with the pecans worked perfectly. A very unique and delicious take on a classic breakfast."

The place is really loud and I couldn't hear my partner despite sitting in front of him.\n\nWe ordered a few drinks, including an cappuccino. The serve staff brought out sugar packets, but didn't bring or offer a spoon for stirring.\n\nI ordered the huevos rancheros and the plating was awful. It looks like everything was put together hastily and without thought. The crema was served off to the side of the plate and it was just a blob of cream. The tortillas tasting fresh from a plastic bag and weren't even warm.\n\nPartner ordered the shakshuka and that was decent. Our other dining partner ordered the country breakfast and got half a slice of bread with her meal. For the price, I'd expect at least a full slice."

We almost always go to Le Monde next door--to the point that I forgot he wanted to go to Community so I was seated outside at Le Monde waiting for him while he was seated outside Community waiting for me.\n\nAnyway, the food was really good. I got the breakfast burrito with turkey chorizo and he got the French Dip. The Dip looked amazing. My burrito was totally satisfying--I also really like their hot sauce--not sure if it is homemade. It isn't that spicy but has a good flavor like Frank's with a bit more of a kick.\n\nThe service was also excellent and the outdoor space was nice. The other thing I like about it is that they were totally ok with people coming to the restaurant, getting coffee, and working on their laptops. Very unpretentious vibes from a neighborhood that can be very pretentious. Will post photos next time I go!\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend."

            "text": "Let me start by saying that the ambience inside of this establishment is quite nice; albeit they still look like they are under construction, as one side has obvious plaster done and in need of a paint job by the kitchen. Seating is cozy and some of the rest of the space is an \"open concept\". They also have generous outdoor seating, might I add.\n\nMy friend and I ordered dinner. We both had burgers; I had the \"NATURAL GRASS FED BEEF BURGER\", which had Vermont Cabot white cheddar & caramelized onions, with hand cut fries. I clearly told the waitstaff that I wanted my burger medium/well done with no pink showing and no blood. When my burger arrives, it was room temperature, and the inside looked slightly raw. Not too mention, the fries weren't crispy.\n\nWe also ordered the MAC-N-CHEESE BOWL, which consisted of White Cabot cheddar sauce (they must be getting a deal on this cheese because it's on everything in this damn restaurant). I have never had a more bland Mac & cheese in my life. It tasted like sawdust and styrofoam baked at 375 degrees. Come to think of it; it didn't even smell like any Mac & cheese that I have had as of late. Whomever added that dish to the menu needs to be written up.\n\nMy friend got the GRILLED SALMON BURGER, made in house with wild organic salmon, served with avocado, arugula, wasabi mayo, and a side of dressed local greens and noticed while they gave him avocado, there was no tomato or red onion. Since when do these vegetable come a la carte?!? I can't with the shenanigans.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the ambience, it definitely could've been better. I don't think this restaurant is a place known for the seasoning of its food; the presentation is cool but the flavor just isn't there. For a moment, I thought I caught COVID because I couldn’t taste anything. The waitstaff are pleasant individuals, though. But I would eat a bowl of water with a fork before ever eating here, again."

From the moment we were seated, the experience went downhill. The place was swarming with flies—one even landed right on the rim of my glass (took Picture), which was already dirty when we sat down.\n\nOur server seated us and then completely disappeared. We waited far too long with no follow-up, no drinks, nothing. When the food finally came out, it was quick—but unfortunately, not authentic or flavorful. It felt rushed and lacked the care I expected from a place claiming to offer a “community” vibe.\n\nTo make matters worse, it was obvious that regulars two white ladies not that it matters got much better service and attention. As a first-time customer, I felt completely overlooked. There was no warmth, no hospitality, and definitely no sense of community.\n\nI will not be returning—and I strongly recommend others skip this spot entirely. Plenty of better options out there that actually value thier customers"

The food is still nice, but you can definitely notice subtle changes of decreased use of fresh ingredients. Honesty, for the prices they're preaching, it is better to go to Le Monde next store. Not worth a small egg white omelet for 25 dollars and literally to sub a side (e.g., potatoes or fries) for 1/4 a cup of fruit is 5 dollars extra!! You can literally go down the to the convenient store a few blocks down and get fresh cut fruit 0.5 lb for a few bucks more. It is down right thief what they are charging."

The ambiance was undeniably charming—a blend of natural light and thoughtful decor that seemed designed to offer diners a comforting respite. However, glancing over, I couldn’t help but notice an unsightly stack of chairs in the corner, a detail that momentarily broke the otherwise polished setting.\n\nService was attentive, with staff offering courteous and prompt assistance upon request. Yet, when it came to the cuisine, I found myself underwhelmed. For a restaurant of such acclaim, I expected a culinary journey marked by creativity and bold flavors. Instead, each dish, though adequately prepared, felt surprisingly ordinary, lacking the refinement and depth that would elevate the experience from pleasant to truly memorable. The coffee, too, was unexpectedly disappointing, perhaps among the most uninspiring I’ve encountered in New York—a surprising flaw for an establishment of this caliber.\n\nWhile there are undeniable charms here, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the restaurant’s reputation has outpaced its reality, leaving me to wonder if the journey was justified."

I highly recommend the lentil salad with its caramelized leeks and the carrot hash browns. I really applaud their unique and fresh offerings.

            "text": "Community, for those who didn’t already know, is the sister restaurant to the famous Clinton Street Baking Co. whose pancakes continually topped the charts in the NYC. So naturally, the brunch menu is pretty bulletproof (especially the pancakes). I tried their brunch twice, and dinner menu twice, and all the time the food is good. Not as memorable as some of the iconic brunch restaurants but you got your money’s worth.\n\nFocus on the most recent dinner here:\n\nAppetizer:\nBowl of Beets\nThe name suggests simplicity, yet the flavors it delivered were more complicated and in depth. These are fresh beets with whipped goat cheese, toasted pistachios, and topped with balsamic vinegar reductions. I asked the reduction to be on the side as I am a dipper (like to dip things) who adjust my own sauciness. The ingredients were fresh, and it happened to be the beet season so the beets were naturally sweeter. The goat cheese is creamy and accompanied well with the beets and the nutty aroma of crunchy pistachios. The balsamic reduction is tangy and that acidity balances the dish.\n\nEntrees:\nPan-seared salmon\nCrispy skin with tender interior. The portion is great (the fish is bigger than I imagined). I changed the sides from mashed potato to green beans. The green beans are a little undercooked, and both the beans and the spinach are on the saltier side. I asked to have the glaze on the side because i want to taste the salmon and I don’t like overly sweetened fish. The glaze is a bit less ginger forward than I wanted, tastes more sweet than savory.\n\nMaryland Crab cakes\nTwo fist-sized crab cakes with a ton of crab meat paired with GBD waffle fries and herby mayo underneath. This is the perfect bowl of comfort food if you are craving warmth. The crab cakes can be a bit stuffy due to crab meat density, but this is not a complaint as who doesn’t want more crabs in their crab cake. The fries are crispy and tantalizing on the tongue, perfect with mayonnaise sauce they provided. The lemon aids to counterbalance the flavor, and to offsets any possible greasiness.\n\nOur server did a great job to accommodate my requests, which I do appreciate. Yet the service isn’t the best. The water initially took forever to come and the check took a little while too. Overall, the food, the value, and the proximity (near Columbia campus) deserve neighborhood people a re-visit."

The restaurant was very cold despite us sitting inside and our food took a long time to be served.\n\nThe burger was dry and tasteless, and charging $2 for a slice of cheese is ridiculous. The fries were cut far too small, the coleslaw and pickle were both dry.\n\nWe have heard good things about the breakfast service at this restaurant, so perhaps this is just not a good dinner place."

I was pleasantly surprised how busy it was but it wasn’t rowdy or noisy and I was able to get a table easily when I came in. I liked how the ambiance was very family friendly. The service I received from the staff was excellent. They very kind and prompt. When I saw the menu I told myself that I’m definitely coming back because there were so many things I wanted to try. The latte I ordered was delicious. I loved how cute the foam art was. The Carboholic was right about the pancakes. They were very yummy. Fluffy but not dry. I love that this restaurant serves breakfast/lunch until 3:30pm everyday. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone because I, myself would definitely come back here from time to time.

A nice spot near Columbia University and Riverside Park.\n\nNow, the tables were set up community style, so there will be people sitting next to you. It did feel a little crowded at times because the tables behind us were quite close.\n\nOverall nice little spot."

I do believe that this place could use a renovation as I felt the chairs were a bit broken (from the rubber piece). The pancakes are really good!! I would highly recommend having it with maple syrup instead of maple butter 😋"

            "text": "Great quality and reasonably priced brunch and coffee spot on the Upper West Side with good vegetarian options and excellent service. Sometimes crowded, but I have never had to wait too long for a table if at all. The huevos rancheros with tofu scramble instead of eggs are my favorite. All eggs can be substituted with tofu scramble if you desire.\n\nThere are free refills on the coffee and the coffee is extremely good. The jam, biscuits, and hash browns are also excellent.\n\nEdit:\nFinally tried this place for dinner. Macaroni and cheese and tomato soup were satisfying and tasty. My fiancée enjoyed the salmon bowl very much. The place was not as crowded for dinner as it is for brunch , but there still were no outdoor seats available. Overall this is a good place to go for dinner , but even better for brunch."

It tasted amazing. (Paid 33$ for dish and a Latte and I think that’s okay for New York prices and the quality of food I got)\n\nWould definitely come here again."
