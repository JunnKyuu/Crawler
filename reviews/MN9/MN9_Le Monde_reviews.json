It felt like they prepared food and kept it under the lights for a little too long. I was starving so I ate it all anyway. They offered to make me another plate and charged me full price for it? Thought that was weird. But the food is good! I just couldn’t give it all stars. Hopefully it’s something they’ll pay closer attention to. Brunch tends to be a lot more difficult to manage at a lot of places I’m not quite sure why ? Maybe that’s why they need to prep in advance?"

The worst part was that my daughter’s crêpe included a type of meat she doesn’t eat — which was upsetting, as it could just as easily have been an ingredient she’s allergic to. I’m not sure where the mix-up happened, but considering that we had to get up to find sugar for our coffee, and that a pen nearly ended up in our orange juice, I have my suspicions. In any case, her originally ordered omelette only arrived once the rest of our party had finished eating."

            "text": "Review: A Sublime French Dining Experience in New York\n\nIf you’re dreaming of a night that feels like a chic stroll down a Parisian boulevard, this New York French spot delivers, with a warmth and finesse that makes you feel instantly at home.\n\nAmbience\nDesign:** Elegant, timeless, with soft lighting and tasteful art that whispers “bonsoir” rather than shouting it. The dining room has a refined, intimate feel—perfect for a date night or a celebratory dinner.\nAtmosphere:** Quiet enough to carry conversation, yet lively enough to remind you you’re in the heart of the city. The clink of crystal and the gentle hum of guests create an authentic French bistro vibe.\n\nService\nWait staff:** The standout feature. Attentive without being overbearing, genuinely hospitable, and impeccably knowledgeable about the menu. Our server anticipated needs before we even realized them—refilling water glasses right as they approached and offering thoughtful wine pairings.\nTiming:** Courses arrived with pristine pacing, allowing us to savor each dish without feeling rushed. The team checked in at just the right moments—present when needed, invisible when not.\n\nCuisine\nAppetizers:** A refined starter selection that showcases freshness and balance. The escargots were garlicky and tender, while the tartare showed a perfect kiss of citrus brightness.\nMains:** The seafood dish was a standout—delicately seasoned, with the right textural contrast. The duck confit melted on the palate, paired with a subtly spiced sauce that elevated the dish without overpowering it.\nDesserts:** A Parisian finale in miniature—the chocolate mille-feuille had crisp layers and a velvety ganache, and the crème brûlée had a caramelized top that crackled just as it should.\nWine list:** Thoughtfully curated, with a strong French section and a few well-chosen imports from nearby regions. The sommelier’s recommendations perfectly complemented each course.\n\nHighlights\nThe attention to detail extended to the table settings and bread service. A warm, crusty baguette with a lightly salted butter set the tone for the meal.\nThe staff’s enthusiasm for the restaurant’s story—its origin, its inspirations—added a personal touch that felt rare and special.\n\nValue\nWhile the dining experience leans upscale, the quality, craftsmanship, and service justify the price. It’s a memorable night out that feels both luxurious and accessible with the right occasion.\nDr Debby Smith"

The food is always delicious, and the atmosphere is warm and casual, which I really enjoy. Especially the mussels were really good so we ordered baguette to eat the broth. Freshly baked baguette was really good with the broth. But The fish wasn’t very fresh, so it had a slightly fishy smell. The short rib was really tender and flavorful and fries were really crispy. The texture of noodles served with short rib were soft and great with short rib’s sauce.\nDuck hash for Sunday lunch was also great. Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned well. I loved it.\n\nThe servers are always friendly and welcoming. But I’ll never forget this one handsome young guy who served us once—he was chewing gum the entire time! He was witty and kind, but from start to finish, he never stopped chewing gum. I don’t think that’s appropriate behavior when serving customers at a restaurant."

I got to experience some of their lunch/dinner cuisine this time instead of brunch.\nThe honey thyme lemonade was refreshing and had a nice little zing to it that's to the sprig of thyme in it 🌿\nThe raviollini gratinee was *chef's kiss* 👌🏾It was a nice light cheesy amalgamation with the soft cushiony ravioli pasta. I asked the waiter for some croutons to make it even more perfect. I didn't finish it only because I wanted to save room for the main course 😋\nThe coq au vin was delightful~ So packed with flavor and piping hot to boot. The chicken was so tender and the vegetables were succulent. The brine (gravy?) had a lot of flavor profiles in it, but I could point tone that reminded me of liquor. Like a wine? Some kind of cooking alcohol perhaps. It stood out to me, but I was still able to stomach half of the stew before I got full. The mashed potatoes were so little and creamy like a little palette cleanser. The bread that came with the meal was delicious all by itself, it must be homemade and fresh.\nI was very happy to have returned here, I most definitely will come back again another day. Perhaps for the Summer restaurant week towards the end of July! 😁🙏🏾"

The staff was friendly, attentive, and made sure we felt welcome from the moment we walked in.\n\nHowever, the wait for our food was a different story. Despite the excellent service in terms of hospitality, it took an unusually long time for the duck meat to arrive. I understand that quality takes time, but the extended delay left us a bit frustrated."

The 1-hour unlimited mimosa offering during brunch was a great bonus — totally worth it! Our server Mr. Ali, took such great care of us and made the experience even more enjoyable. Big thanks to him for the warm hospitality!"

            "text": "Dining at Le Monde in New York was one of the best restaurant experiences we’ve ever had, and the credit goes first and foremost to Marco, our incredible waiter. From the moment we sat down, Marco made us feel welcome, relaxed, and completely taken care of. He wasn’t just attentive—he anticipated what we needed, guided us through the menu with ease, and added a warmth that turned a great lunch into something unforgettable.\n\nWe came all the way from Florida because we knew exactly what we wanted: the duck. It’s usually only available at dinner, but Marco didn’t let that be an obstacle. He immediately spoke with Chef José Luis, who went out of his way to prepare the dish specially for us at lunch. That extra effort meant the world to us—it showed just how much this team values their guests.\n\nThe duck was every bit as exquisite as we remembered: tender, flavorful, and plated beautifully. Marco’s genuine care, paired with Chef José Luis’s willingness to go above and beyond, gave us a meal—and a memory—we’ll be talking about for years.\n\nIf you want more than just a meal but a true experience where you’re treated like family, ask for Marco at Le Monde. He’s the kind of waiter who turns dining into a celebration."

The service is always excellent, with staff who are attentive, thoughtful, and genuinely kind. The food never disappoints and every visit has been consistently good. Even the little details stand out since the restrooms are always clean, which is something I appreciate. It is a place I continue to return to with my mom, both for the great experience and for the way it reminds us of Paris. I truly recommend it. And Luis is the best Server!!!!!"

Service was top notch thanks to La Shawny! I hope I’m spelling it correctly 😅 but very kind gentleman! Thank you for wonderful brunch I had here! :)"

Louise the waiter is the very best. Ive had the steak frites, roast chicken, salmon, flatbread, soufflés and Caesar salad. For me the roast chicken and Caesar are top drawer and I love their wine by the glass list. Just a treat of a place."

Hamburger to risotto to the chocolate mousse-suggestions were spot on.\nEdited 9/6 to encourage you to once more to find yourself sitting at a table here having a drink and dinner. Tried new menu items and were pleased with both! We'll be back!"

We absolutely loved the shrimp. For dessert, we had the apple tart, which was served warm with ice cream on top. Everything was amazing. Many thanks to bartender Ali for giving us such a wonderful experience."
