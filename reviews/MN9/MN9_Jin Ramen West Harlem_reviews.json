I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen and a side of karaage, both of which were excellent. The ramen serving was generous in a rather large bowl. The chashu slices were very tender and a good thickness, and had a delicious sweet glaze on them. The broth was rich and the meal was filling without needing to order more noodles. Not cheap but not too expensive either, especially considering the high quality. I’m definitely planning to go back and try some other options. My food was served quickly after ordering, but I felt like the service after that wasn’t particularly attentive - no waiter checked in after I got my food, and I had to wait around for a while after finishing before I could get the check. Not a huge deal though, and the servers were still polite and the food was excellent."

The space is small but can has many small tables and the ambiance is cool with dim lighting and different photos and even action figure pieces on the walls. We got the veggie gyozas and karaage to start which left a lot to be desired, to put it simply the food lacked flavor :/ as our time there went on and we waited for our main dish, ramen, our waiter barely attended us and we had to flag him down several times to ask for more water, napkins and drinks. Even when my friend returned her drink bc she didn't like it after just one sip, the waiter rolled his eyes and gave us such a deep sigh, we found the interaction very rude as if we had insulted him directly. Finally our ramen came out. I got the shrimp ramen and my friend the chicharron ramen. It was much more flavorful than the appetizers but nothing very special. The consensus: we've had better elsewhere. I wouldn't highly recommend this place considering the service was significantly lacking and the food was mid at best...."

Overall it’s a good ramen spot and worth a try if you’re near one of their three locations in the city.\n\nThe kuro tonkotsu features a rich broth packed with black garlic oil aroma. The grilled cha shu was smoky and perfectly glazed with sweet sauce. The soft-boiled egg was cooked to perfection. They used thin noodles which held the soup pretty well.\n\nMy friend ordered their signature spicy tonkotsu. The broth was quite spicy in Japanese food standard, but not overbearing. A nice option if you want to spice up your ramen.\n\nYou can get a complimentary yuzu drink if you order an entree. It was so refreshing for this weather and cleansed our palate after the meal."

I regretted not switching my noodle type to curly because it looked more like traditional ramen where as my flat noodles seemed more like flattened udon. But the black garlic oil was really good, and even the salad exceeded my expectations.\nThe second time I went though, it took a long time for my curry udon to come, and when it did, it was only average. The katsu on it was stringy and hard to chew in places. The Karaage was super good though.\nI'm still going to go again though.
