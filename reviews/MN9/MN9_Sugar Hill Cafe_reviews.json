While the food here is decently priced for its quality, I’ve had an unpleasant experience with staff members on multiple occasions. The cafe is very cramped, which can become stressful, but the staff seemed to work against these circumstances, not with them. In today’s case, I felt that one of the baristas was especially rude to my party for no apparent reason other than the store was crowded. I will personally never come back, and I would never recommend this place to a friend - which is a shame because this place has lots of potential."

Whether I'm grabbing a quick espresso or lingering over a perfectly crafted cappuccino with its velvety smooth microfoam, I'm never disappointed. And speaking of treats, you absolutely must try their blueberry cheesecake. The creamy texture, the bursts of sweet and tart blueberries, and that buttery crust create a truly divine experience. It pairs perfectly with their cappuccino, making for an ideal little indulgence.\nBut what elevates Sugarhill Cafe from just a good coffee shop to a truly exceptional one is their excellent customer service. From the moment you walk in, you're greeted with genuine warmth and a smile. The baristas are not only efficient but also incredibly friendly and attentive. They remember your order, offer helpful suggestions, and create a welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel like a valued regular. Even during the hustle and bustle of the city, they maintain a sense of calm and care. You leave Sugarhill Cafe not just with a delicious coffee and perhaps a slice of that incredible blueberry danish, but also with a feeling of having been genuinely looked after. It's a delightful neighborhood gem that offers both quality and exceptional service – highly, highly recommended!"

They truly nail the coffee – it's consistently delicious, with a rich aroma and satisfying flavor. Their cappuccino, in particular, is a real treat; the espresso has a lovely depth, and the milk is steamed to a perfect, silky texture.\nBeyond the excellent brews, their blueberry danish is something special. It's got this wonderful creamy richness punctuated by juicy bursts of blueberry, all resting on a beautifully crumbly base. Trust me, it's the kind of dessert you'll want to savor slowly. Pairing it with their expertly made cappuccino is just chef's kiss – the flavors complement each other perfectly.\nHowever, what really makes Sugarhill Cafe stand out is their top-notch customer service. The team there is just so welcoming and friendly. They're efficient and attentive, always ready with a smile and a kind word. It's clear they take pride in what they do and genuinely appreciate their customers. In a city where interactions can sometimes feel rushed, Sugarhill Cafe offers a refreshing sense of community and care. It's more than just a coffee shop; it's a place where you feel good from the moment you walk in. If you're looking for fantastic coffee, delectable treats, and truly outstanding service, Sugarhill Cafe is a must-visit!"

But the vanilla caramel latte I had here is what I wish all lattes I’ve ever had could be. The only better coffee I’ve had in life was an egg coffee in Vietnam, so if you’re not planning on heading there for brunch I’d recommend getting a coffee here.\n\nThe service is super lovely, friendly, and the atmosphere is cosy. I also noticed the few times I’ve popped in that there are constant regulars who seem to know everyone well. In a time of impersonal coffee chains, it’s so nice to have a feeling of true community in the form of a neighborhood coffee shop.\n\nEdited to add: I just tried the Korean omelette because it was recommended. I’m not an omelette fan but I eat for health so I figured I’d try it. I’m not kidding when I say this is the most beautifully flavoured omelette I’ve ever had.  It’s not too subtle and not too much, and I’m afraid I’ll have to be make a whole new omelette budget in my life now…."

I received a look of \"well of duh\" yet they weren't runny. I will say this though the hollandaise sauce was on POINT and the bacon was good too. My bad that I didn't realize (nor apparently read) that it didn't come with a crumpet or english muffin as it's vessel LOL\n\nThe french toast was sooooo good too oh and the breakfast potatoes Manifique! All in all if you are in the area and you want something tasty that hit's the spot in your tummy come here! Street parking can be found and it's a short walk from the subway station. They have outdoor seating but we moseyed our way down the steps to where the restaurant was and sat inside. They had a communal table as well as 2 tops and (1) 4 in the rear by the restroom. Air conditioning too for these hot summer months is always a plus while dining.\n\nRespectfully Reviewed."

I ordered \"The sophisticated\" avocado toast and it is SCRUMPTIOUS. Lastly, I loved working here. I did not feel pressured to buy or rush! My only suggestion would be getting gluten free options.  Despite that, I highly recommend this cafe."

We expected a hidden gem with friendly service and good food, but instead got chaos in slow motion.\n\nCoffee took 20 minutes, the staff kept forgetting our order, and food arrived without utensils — when I asked, I was told they ran out of clean ones.\nUnfortunately, the food and coffee weren’t good either."

They offer a wide variety of brunch options, and everything I’ve tried has been delicious. The service is friendly, definitely a spot I’d come back to."

But the real five stars comes from the people here — all are so kind and fun and make the cafe feel like a cozy apartment. Talk to Isa, Grace Blue or Trent for just a couple minutes and your day will be better 🌞 This is def my favorite spot to hang out."

The iced vanilla latte is good!"
