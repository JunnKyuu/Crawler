This used to be a really nice place but the inside  has deteriorated. Although the food service workers wear gloves, the cashiers don’t and they are sometimes the last ones to touch your food. Also pay  attention to their pricing policy too. If you want a regular falafel, it’s 11.50. If you order for pickup it’s 12.50. And if you don’t want a pita it’s +$2.00 (pickup or in store).  So $14.50 for the same food."

A falafel fantasy stuffed with creamy hummus, crunchy Israeli salad, silky tahini… all wrapped in a pita that, well, felt a little like it missed the invitation to the flavor party.\n\nBut let’s not get stuck on carbs—because the falafel balls? Oh, the falafel balls! Golden-crisp like they just stepped out of a sunbeam, soft and herby on the inside like a secret whispered in a spice market. These weren’t your run-of-the-mill dry hockey pucks—these were handcrafted bites of joy.\n\nThe hummus? Smooth and dreamy. The Israeli salad? Crunchy, bright, and full of life. And the portion? Generous. Like, four falafel orbs of glory—I couldn’t even finish the sandwich, though my taste buds begged me to try.\n\nIf they ever start baking their own pita, this place might just dethrone the falafel king himself. (Speaking of which—Turco in Midtown, I still see you.)\n\nBottom line: this sandwich slaps. It sings. It crunches. It comforts. And if you’re on the hunt for a legit falafel fix in NYC, this spot deserves a place in your rotation."

It is one of very few places that also offer drinking water free of cost and that also adds to the good service. I do recommend the place. Do try the soups, if you are visiting there."

Everyone really liked theirs but there are a few key things to note.\n\nHeat levels are relative but the guy in our group who got the Red Hot Chili said it really wasn’t that hot. I’m not sure how else to guide outside of, he loves his food spicy and he rated this as low spicy.\n\nFor the Popeye Delight, the main comment was too much red cabbage, not enough spinach.\n\nWe all agreed that the Tahini sauce was great! Really good sauce composition here 🙌\n\nWe all also agreed that the portions were bigger than we were expecting which was great. We got a hummus appetizer but couldn’t finish it since we started to eat it after we had our sandwiches.\n\nLastly, I’m giving it a 4-star for service because it wasn’t too busy when we were there but the tables were a little dirty. We wiped it up no problem but still something we shouldn’t have to do as customers.\n\nShould you visit this spot, I hope you enjoy as much as we did 👍"

The food is okay, not the greatest! Ordered the deluxe pita sandwich and the red hot chilli pita sandwich.These were of decent portion,loaded actually,stuffed with veggies and eggplant.Not the best pita sandwich I have had but I guess these are of Israeli cuisine.Never had one so can't comment on the authenticity!

Get the Lemonana drink , it's a delicious lemonade with fresh mint and really hits the spot . We got a side of fried cauliflower with tahini and while it was delicious I would say only order it if it's at least 2 or 3 people since it's quite a good portion size and if you're alone it will be hard to finish with the rest of your food.  I got a Falafel platter which has 9 Falafel in 3 different flavors with salads and 2 pita. I liked the tomato flavored one the best and brought the leftovers home . My friend got the Masabacha Hummus with Chickpea and egg on top and thought it was really smooth and liked it. This place can get busy and seems really popular.  Staff are really nice. About 5 blocks from City Hall . Good spot."

The baklava was also great - it was milder and not as sweet if that is your preference. Classy and unique vibe for a quick lunch or casual dinner."

Pedimos um prato que era o Falafel Trio (17,50 dólares) que servia 2 pessoas. Vinha 3 tipos de falafel, hommus, tarine, tabule, pão pita! Era bem servido e delicioso! Também pedimos um salada verde com falafel era bem delícia ! Era tudo muito saboroso e o atendimento bem legal!"

The servings were very generous and the flavor was not lacking by any means. The falafel was delectably crispy and the hummus was the perfect balance of spices and smoothness. The pita was perfectly fluffy. The greek salad and salad on the platter were so refreshing and a perfect pairing with the rest of our food. Great quality, great price!! Thank you, will definitely be coming back!!"

I don’t think it’s mentioned on the menu, but you can order a side of halloumi (they’re more like halloumi bites and they’re delicious).  The labneh was also nice and tangy and a great thick consistency."
