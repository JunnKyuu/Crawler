However, my recent visit at 5:30 PM with a party of five was nothing short of disappointing.\n\nUpon arrival, we were met at the front by a gentleman who was immediately dismissive and rude. Without any effort to accommodate or welcome us, he told us we could \"crowd around the bar.\" The tone and delivery were unnecessarily dismissive, a stark contrast to the hospitality I’ve come to expect at Nobu.\n\nThings unfortunately didn’t improve. He later walked past our table and gave us a pointed, unfriendly look, which felt like a deliberate mean mug. When one of our guests politely asked where the restroom was, he responded with clear irritation, even rolling his eyes. As we were leaving, he gave me a long, passive aggressive stare that felt both unprofessional and uncalled for.\n\nI’ve never encountered this kind of behavior in all my years of frequenting Nobu, and it truly makes me reconsider returning. I'm not sure where this individual's energy came from this evening, but his demeanor and approach are entirely misaligned with the Nobu standard of experience."

Ordered the chefs set menu….dishes were rapid fire…we asked for a  short break between the 3rd and 4th… curtly told we were on a short timeframe to turn the tables.   Lost interest in the food, server and Nobu from that point on.  We boxed up the remaining dishes and left.  Had the server explained the tight timeframe and oversized portions we could have made an informed decision.  The attitude of the place really rubs against what the kitchen tries really hard to deliver… disappointing!"

We had 4 sushi rolls, the best one was mediocre at best. The edamame was not as good as the frozen bag from the grocery store. Our server obviously didn’t want to be there. A note for others, was offered “still or sparkling” water when we sat, seemed like a setup to make another $9/bottle from us, as “tap” wasn’t initially offered. Just seemed like they are cashing in on the Nobu name, not delivering a great meal. Go elsewhere, we had 6 other GREAT meals, this was noticeably below those."

The sashimi salad with Matushisa dressing used to be a rather grand looking family style dish, but it has shrunk to a sad and unremarkable size. I asked the server which dishes are served with yamamomo Japanese mountain peaches and she informed that she wasn't aware of them served anymore. The dessert bento boxes used to have more than just 2 items. The place was so empty on a Friday night! It was my friend's first time trying Nobu and felt that although all the food was very good, it wasn't too different from that which is served at places like Buddakhan and Zuma. I informed that Nobu predated them and used to be better. Hope things turn around."

The upstairs bar era was extremely well designed with an upscale and luxury yet cozy atmosphere—really great for a casual bite and drinks. But I will say the host upstairs wasn’t the friendliest so I took a star away.\n\nMoving down to the main dining room; as per the interior design upstairs being beautiful, it was beautiful downstairs as well.\n\nWe had the MOST amazing server ever named Esteban!! He remembered us from 2 months ago which was very sweet!\n\nThe service was very attentive even though it was a very busy night with a private event going on. All the water cups were refilled, the tables were all crumbed very neat, plates were changed every course, and everything came out very promptly.\n\nThe food was also absolutely delicious! I highly recommend the miso cod which just absolutely melts in your mouth as well as the buttery scallop sashimi.\n\nI have been coming to Nobu every week and it truly never disappoints!"

The service remains poor. I will not return until there are real improvements.\n\nReview September 2025: 4 stars\n\nThere’s a new lunch prix fixe menu—$45 for a three-course meal—and it’s excellent. The service has also improved.\nThank you!!!!\n\nOld review 2024: 2 stars\nThe service is terrible. A high-end restaurant should provide much better service.

            "text": "I want to Preface this review by saying the customer service upstairs (bar area) was nothing short of top notch!\nAs far as the restaurant area (downstairs) our experience was rather unpleasant. We were seated for 10 minutes before the waiter KEVIN decided to show up . He never greeted us and tried to avoid coming over for 10 mins while talking to other patrons . Once at our table he stated “you have questions?” My Finance and I looked up to see him standing off to the side . We tried to inquire about several dishes he had no interest in explaining , rushed us actually to order. And when we asked for a specific sauce he insulted us with a sarcastic response. My food came out first I practically finished my food before my finances food arrived he never came back to check on us. Fast forward a couple sat right behind us at 930pm Kevin showed up at 932 greeted said couple annoyed the specials even told them his favorites to top it off he suggested he will talk to the chef on his behalf. It was just very disturbing. Needless to say we were the only Black couple in the section . It’s just very sad in today’s society that these people are allowed to work in customer service positions without consequences for their actions. We are regulars at the other Nobu locations and expected top notch service at the Downtown restaurant. We will not be returning and will definitely spread the word about the blatant racial discrimination from Kevin."

In the sushi course, the shrimp is overcooked. very chewy. not a good idea. The rest two courses, the protein was cooked perfectly but the sauce was way too salty. We did not want to have caffeinated desserts late in the day. They replaced the dessert with a browny. Boy, is that thing sweet. And, to make things even worse, they paired it with a sweet wine. Can you have a backup plan for people who do not sleep well? I suspect they just pulled the browny out of the fridge. A honeydew melon would be more appropriate. Overall, the menu ison the heavy side for the season."

Great place to have a date or for a celebration.\n\nI had the pleasure of having June as our waitress and she was superb. She gave us more insight in the flavor profiles and some recommendations. Her service was great and I would come back just to have her take care of everything.\n\nNow for the food, I loved everything except the shittake salad but that’s only because of a texture sensitivity I have, the lemon dressing in the salad was great. The edamame choclo is the best edamame I’ve had, it was spicy and the Peruvian corn it comes with complements the dish so well. I loved the crispy rice with the spicy tuna, the crispy rice is so buttery and the spicy tuna on top was amazing. The rock shrimp was delicious and fresh. The yellowtail and jalapeño was a great burst of freshness with the spice of the jalapeño had my tastebuds dancing. The wagyu dumpling were soooo filling and delicious, I want to try the tacos next time.\n\nJune also got me and my partner a small bite with some writing to congratulate on our anniversary which was so kind!!! (We couldn’t order dessert because we were SO full but the passion fruit baked Alaska looked soooo good from what I saw other guests)\n\nEverything was delicious and I understand the hype now."

            "text": "I have been meaning to try Nobu out for a while and tonight was that night.  It's a beautiful spot for a date night or special occasion.  The food was solid, the cocktails were amazing, and the service was quite good.\n\nNobu Sidecar (fantastic cocktail)\n\n-Toro Nigiri (amazing.  One of my favorite bites of the night)\n\n-Unagi Nigiri (very good.  Melts in your mouth)\n\n-Yellowtail w/ jalapeño & cilantro (although it had some kick to it and the cilantro flavor was pronounced, it is a very good dish)\n\n-Crispy Rice w/ Spicy tuna (spicy tuna spread was great.  The crispy rice cubes were ok.   I personally think this appetizer is skippable)\n\n-Shishito Peppers w/ sea salt (solid appetizer.   I'd love them blistered a bit more but they were still solid)\n\nNobu Tacos (Tuna & Salmon.  These were the perfect bites.  The salmon ones were my preferred option)\n\nScallops with spicy garlic (super flavorful!!! Just needs some rice or something to sop up the sauce)\n\nBlack Miso Cod (solid piece of fish. BADLY needs more of the sauce, instead of the 4 dots they give you.  Also does not come with a side of rice or veggies.  Just the piece of fish.)\n\nSoba-cha Brownie (a solid dessert option.  Felt rich but light at the same time.  I'd get it again)\n\nOverall. My experience at Nobu was nice.  The food was quite good (with some room for minor improvements). The cocktails were the stars of the show.  Thank you!"

            "text": "Food tasted great (except the wagyu dumplings but my friend thought they were amazing) but the portions are so small. Feels like snacks almost. Fish is comparable to other sushi spots. Expected fish to be better because of the hype. Still good though, except the wagyu tbh. Toro was great! The tuna tartar as well. Yellow tail was great. Eggplant great. Miso soup great. Just wanted bigger portions but I guess you pay for the atmosphere, which was also comparable to other spots"

            "text": "I had a wonderful experience at Nobu Downtown. The food was phenomenal, the atmosphere great, and the service was some of the best I’ve had in a while. My wife and I were unsure what to order with so many great options on the menu, but our server guided us through it and was extremely helpful. We ended up having the yellowtail jalapeño, the crispy rise with tuna, toro and scallion sushi roll, shrimp and lobster with spicy lemon sauce, and black cod with miso. We also had the buttermilk doughnuts for dessert. Not a single one of the courses we had disappointed. We will definitely be back soon! Would highly recommend."

It was so fresh. I also got the donuts also very good. The lychee martini was delicious as well. Service was good but a bit slow. The interior is beautiful as well. Such a nice time."

This way diners have the opportunity to share and try multiple things on the menu (because everything is amazing) The staff are all so energetic and emphasize on the happiness of the customer. The lowlight atmosphere gives it an elegant vibe adding to the overall experience. The crispy rice with spicy tuna and lobster tacos are my absolute favorite dishes!"

The sushi plates were okay. the espresso martini ✨ was so yummy.\nThe service was great - the only issue I noticed is they seemed rushing my group to finish meals quickly by asking to finish food to take the plates. Everyone in the group felt so rushed.\nit's been the second time I tried Nobu. I think I prefer this spot more than the other location in the city (5th Avenue) I tried though."

Und die Nachspeisen sollte man nicht auslassen.\nDas Ambiente war gut. Es war sehr gut besucht und ich gemischtes Publikum. Sehr lebhaft aber nicht unangenehm laut.\nDer Service war sehr aufmerksam und schnell. Lediglich den Empfang hätte ich mir etwas freundlicher vorgestellt und dass man uns zum Warten an die Bar führt und nicht einfach alleine lässt, ohne klare Anweisungen."
