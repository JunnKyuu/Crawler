            "text": "Great place, and where I first heard about the famous painting they have hanging on the wall\n\nThis painting is known as “The Guardian of the Highway”, created in the late 1970s by an anonymous roadside artist who was once a long-haul trucker himself. Legend has it that after narrowly surviving a catastrophic accident in the Nevada desert, the man claimed to have seen a vision: a figure of Christ appearing above his wrecked rig, arms outstretched in both welcome and protection.\n\nHe gave up trucking soon after and began painting devotional works in small towns along the interstate. Unlike traditional religious art, his subjects always merged the divine with the world of the road—chrome, diesel, and endless highways. This particular piece, featuring a gleaming blue semi beneath the blessing hands of Christ, became a favorite among truck stops and diners across the Midwest, where it was seen as a talisman for safe passage.\n\nTruckers whispered that those who carried a copy of this painting—or even a photograph of it—would find themselves spared from breakdowns and bad weather. Some said that if you looked closely at the truck’s headlights, they seemed to glow faintly in the dark, like guiding beacons on a lonely highway.\n\nToday, “The Guardian of the Highway” survives as folk-art legend: equal parts roadside spirituality, Americana, and the weary hope of those who live their lives between the mile markers\""

They serve unpretentious Tex Mex sprinkled with seafood and burgers. I only tried the nachos but they were absolutely stellar. The beef was high quality, the guacamole was amazing and they make their own hot sauces. The green sauce was my fave. Sadly they don’t bottle the hot sauce for retail sale, or I’d purchase a couple. I can’t wait to return and try the burgers, I saw several of them hustled past me, one with gigantic fluffy onion rings. They looked as good as any burger I’ve seen. This place came highly recommended and it lived up to the hype. Great job."
