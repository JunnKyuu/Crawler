            "text": "I have been holding back in writing this review because I thought time and distance would help me to calm down.  Well, it did not work because I am still enraged over my time and money i wasted at this place.  Why is it still in business and how did this place get 1 star from Michelin?  We were a party of 3, paid over $1700 and that price did not include any alcohol.  My husband booked this place as a surprise and he will never be forgiven for this fiasco.  We have experienced other 1 and 2 stars, paid much less and enjoyed 10 times more.  The chef kept on bragging how everything was from Hokkaido and that was a point of pride for him in his head.  None of us were impressed and did not really care where the ingredient was from when every piece was so mediocre in taste and quality.  There was an arrogance to the chef that forced us to smile and obligated to compliment him with every piece he served us.  We felt like captive animals in the zoo waiting to make our great escape.  All i wanted to do was scream the entire time, run out of the place and get our money back. In the meantime, we kept on drinking the sparkling water to wash out the taste in our mouth and thought the water was included in the fixed price menu of a whopping $1,600.  Nope!  The meal of $1600 was prepaid by my insane husband and they handed us another receipt in a fancy wood box telling us to pay another $170+ for the water they kept on serving us.  The point of this review is for you to think twice before you book and overpay for this so called 1 star Michelin.   UGH!!!"

            "text": "Traditional omakase counter restaurant, however the food and the whole experience has a next level twist. The chef pushes outside the traditional sushi path and combines things like sashimi with fermented okra jelly (delicious). You'll get a bit of everything - nigris (some of them are experimental), different forms of tuna, grilled fish and meat too. We opted for sake pairing and it was absolutely worth it from taste perspective, but we'd like to highlight the knowledge of the staff describing the differences and nuances to us. You might also get a complimentary Koshu wine from japan that goes with one of the dishes."

There were a few minor odd choices for a Michelin star restaurant: disposable chopsticks, and laminated plastic signs on the doors.\n\nThe food was a fusion of Japanese and Italian cuisine, and felt completely unique. Flavors that i I didn’t know worked together were delicious. Would definitely return."

The venue/decor is very nice, but the service is shaky and the chef limits eye contact and says as little as possible in a hard-to-hear tone (as others have noted).  The food was good, but not great (what you would expect at this price point).  It has potential and I wanted to love it, but it just isn’t commensurate with the price tag."

            "text": "Icca is best known for their Japanese cuisine, but I was introduced to their Italian Kappo Counter by a friend.\n\nItalian Kappo Counter (Non-Sushi Course)\nAccording to their site, Kappo is a refined, multi-course dining experience that bridges the gap between the formal Kaiseki and Izakaya styles. Originating from the Edo Era, Kappo is a high-class cuisine that grew in popularity during the Taishou and early Showa eras.\n\nTasting course contains the following:\nIppakusuisei \"Premium\" - Fan Lobster, Scallop, Caviar, Udo, Strawberry\nHaneya - Striped Beakfish, Ponzu Julep\nTedorikawa Yamahai - Japanese Blackfin Seabass, White Asparagus\nDassai Blue \"Nama\" - Fennel, Tomato, Julep, Snow Crab, Sea Urchin\nJikon \"Tokubetsu Junmai\" - Cherry Trout, Bamboo Shoots\nSuirakuten Reserve Aged 20 Years - \"Tokachi Herb Beef\" Steak\nIcca Soup\nIwa 5 - Bolognese Risotto with \"Tokachi Herb Beef\"\nMasuizumi \"Kijoshu\" - Chestnut, Monaka\nRoasted Green Tea\n\nThe Ippakusuisei \"Premium\" was incredible--delicate seafood paired with strawberry sounds risky, but it all came together beautifully. The Tedorikawa Yamahai was a standout, topped with a generous amount of truffle that elevated the entire dish. Dassai Blue \"Nama\" leaned a bit more fish-forward, but the flavors were expertly balanced. The Suirakuten Reserve steak was exceptionally tender and full of depth. To end, the Masuizumi \"Kijoshu\" with roasted green tea provided a perfect balance of sweetness and earthiness--an elegant close to the meal. I cannot speak for the other menu offerings at Icca, but I do believe this establishment has mastered their craft and are able to combine it with creativity. I did not have one bad bite throughout the entire meal."

A multitude of otsumami and nigiri fill the night with immense pleasure for your palate. The signature course of Icca is the awabi liver shari. The umami and textures from this signature course are unbelievably divine and unrivaled. On top of all the culinary mastery, Suzuki-san is a friendly and jovial guy that is a willing conversationalist. I’ve visited three times thus far and always make it a priority to visit any time I visit Manhattan."

The concept was Italian Kappo (basically italian/japanese style) and every single food I had here was served in a unique way and tasted delicious (if i can have a second round of each item, i definitely would lol). Service was top notch, chef was super friendly and described every single item perfectly. The atmosphere inside was very chill & relaxing so it was perfect for date night.\n\nOverall, would highly recommend if you're looking for a unique omakase experience that includes an italian twist to Japanese cuisine."

I piatti dall’influ za giapponese sono molto buoni, l’arrivo dell’influenza italiana (sono italiano) non è per nulla all’altezza."

            "text": "icca's Italian Japanese tasting course is not very Italian, but delicious nonetheless.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quiet and unassuming, but operates very smoothly. Unlike other tasting course menus, you will definitely leave full (and they will even ask you if you want a larger portion size towards the end), so come hungry! The dishes are generally fun, and the ingredients are definitely high quality.\n\nI'd say the best courses were the cold pasta with tuna tartare and caviar (could eat a whole bowl of this!), apple compote and caramel mousse dessert, and the mackerel with truffle, while the tokachi herb beef fell short (a little bit too sweet and uncomfortably rich), as well as the red snapper fritto (the brussel sprout and sauce was great, but the fritto was just so average - could easily have been any fish). The fish-y pasta at the end was a lovely way to close off, and in particular, I really loved their use of vegetables throughout the courses. Also, the plum juice is absolutely divine.\n\nI'm not sure if this would be a regular spot for me, but I'd say it's worth a visit, and it's lovely, peaceful, and quiet for a unassuming date night. Would recommend!"

Each dish, especially the sea urchin, was a revelation, showcasing the chef's skill in elevating simple ingredients to culinary heights.The sake pairing was a journey in itself. The house-made sake complemented each course beautifully, enhancing the flavors and adding an extra layer of enjoyment to our meal. The staff's knowledge and passion for sake were evident as they introduced each pairing, making the experience both educational and delightful.As we celebrated this special occasion, the attentive and considerate service made the evening even more memorable. The staff's dedication to ensuring every aspect of our meal was perfect contributed significantly to the joyous atmosphere of the night.In conclusion, our experience at Icca was nothing short of amazing. It was not just a meal, but a celebration of fine cuisine, exceptional service, and a birthday that will be remembered for years to come. A heartfelt thank you to the team at Icca for making this birthday celebration a truly magnificent one."
