            "text": "Eataly is one of those places that manages to capture the true essence of Italy  from the aroma of freshly baked focaccia to the sound of baristas calling out espresso orders in Italian. The moment you walk in, you’re surrounded by a vibrant mix of markets, restaurants, and wine bars that make you forget you’re even in New York. The variety is unmatched. You can grab a perfect cappuccino in the morning, a fresh plate of pasta at lunch, and finish the evening with wine and tiramisu. The ingredients are incredibly fresh most of them imported directly from Italy. The pizza is a standout, especially the Margherita with its chewy crust and fragrant basil. The gelato counter is another must-stop; the pistachio flavor alone is worth the trip. One time I stopped by just to grab olive oil and ended up in a full conversation with one of the staff members about different types of truffle salts. He actually opened a jar for me to smell and recommended pairing it with roasted potatoes or scrambled eggs. That small, genuine gesture turned a quick errand into a memorable experience and yes, I left with the truffle salt and zero regrets."

Unfortunately, when I arrived I was told that I could only sit at the bar because I came alone , which I think is extremely unfair. Why should someone who dines alone be forced to eat at the bar? The bar stools are very uncomfortable without a proper back rest and they're generally not suitable for shorter people. The bar is also a very noisy and unpleasant place to be when you just want to enjoy your meal in peace.\nI was extremely disappointed by their treatment and even though the pizza was good, I won't be coming back."

The food is excellent fresh, authentic Italian dishes with lots of variety. The cappuccino is definitely a highlight, and the whole atmosphere feels vibrant and lively. It’s perfect if you want a quick bite, a coffee, or just to enjoy some Italian flavors without formal table service.

For the price of the ticket, I was hoping for a well organized and authentic Italian food experience with a good variety of tastings. Instead, most of the food was very basic mainly salad and focaccia, and even the arancinis were dry and not tasty at all. Overall, the food lacked flavor and creativity. I actually left feeling hungry and went straight to another restaurant afterward. The only redeeming part was the nice wine selection, which was enjoyable, but not enough to make the experience worth it."

There was a man working on the machines, and from the start he was blocking the aisle to pay without even saying “excuse me.” He began throwing around the baskets and carts as if he didn’t like his job. While I was trying to pay, an error came up in the system and, without asking permission, he started moving the machine while I was still trying to understand what was happening. He treated me however he wanted, without any respect for the customer or the space. I left a bit disappointed with this experience."

Eataly truly feels like stepping into the heart of Italy, right in the middle of New York. Everywhere you turn, there’s something tempting—fresh cheeses, handmade pastas, breads, pastries, sauces, meats, pizzas, and so much more. It’s part marketplace, part restaurant, part sensory overload—in the best way possible.\n\nWe weren’t super hungry when we stopped in, but couldn’t resist grabbing focaccia bread with potatoes and cheese along with a couple of Italian sodas. The quality and authenticity were outstanding, and I can only imagine how amazing a full meal would be here.\n\nWhether you’re looking to shop, snack, or sit down for a proper Italian meal, Eataly is a must-visit in NYC. I’m excited to check out the one in Santa Clara, but I have a feeling it will be hard to top this experience in New York!"

We visited to celebrate our wedding anniversary here and enjoyed every moment of it.\n\nWe ordered Lasagne Emiliane, Spaghetto el Pomodoro e Burrata and Rianata pizza with beer. The food was delicious, pasta and pizza were cooked to perfection.\n\nThe host and the servers were all friendly and kind.\n\nThis Eataly is located inside Westfield World Trade Center. Along with the restaurant, there is also a section for shopping for produce and groceries.\n\nWe hope to return soon."

Good food, it was just pricey. The atmosphere is jam packed, loud and busy so be prepared. Bread is 5-15 bucks depending on what type. Weird, most Italian restaurants give you that on the house. Bring your wallet and stick to the basics."

The atmosphere is vibrant and bustling, with so many food stations and options that it feels like stepping into a little corner of Italy. The quality of ingredients is top-notch, and everything from the freshly made pasta to the wood-fired pizzas tastes authentic and delicious. The marketplace also offers a fantastic selection of Italian groceries, wines, and desserts. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, always ready to recommend dishes or help you navigate the many choices. It’s a must-visit spot in NYC, whether you’re grabbing a quick bite, enjoying a full meal, or stocking up on Italian treats to take home. Highly recommended!"

Sinceramente non pensavo di mangiare un piatto di fettuccine al ragù tanto buono. Suggerisco di provarne altri di primi, tutti cucinati bene. Cacio e pepe nella forma di parmigiano portata al tavolo da cameriere una nota aggiuntiva di qualità. Direi di provare sopratutto per tornare a mangiare bene!!!"
