A couple of days we had breakfast, one night we had dinner, and at least one night we grabbed a late-night snack.\n\nThe prices were great, and the portions were even better. The bagels and sandwiches were excellent.\n\nYou could eat every meal here for two weeks and still not try everything on the menu.\n\nThe staff was always friendly, helpful, and in a great mood.\n\nNext time we're in NYC, we'll definitely be stopping by again!"

The menu is stacked—so many options that it almost feels impossible to pick just one.\n\nI went with the corned beef pastrami loaded with coleslaw and Russian dressing, and wow, that combo hit hard. The bread was fresh, the meat was stacked just right, and that sauce pulled everything together. It was messy in the best way possible.\n\nYou can tell they’ve been doing this for a while—everyone behind the counter moves with purpose. It’s that perfect mix of chaos and efficiency that only a real New York deli can pull off.\n\nCrushed it right before walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it hit the spot perfectly. If you’re ever in the area and need something quick, hearty, and legit good any time of day (or night), this is the move."

Pizza była naprawdę smaczna, dokładnie taka, jakiej można by oczekiwać w Nowym Jorku. Zamówiliśmy do niej napoje oraz kawę, jednak nasz pozytywny odbiór zepsuły trzy kwestie: narzucony napiwek 18% 20% albo 22%, „pomyłka” przy wydawaniu reszty oraz problemy z toaletą. Dlatego choć sama pizza była dobra, całościowo miejsce nie zrobiło na nas aż tak dobrego wrażenia, by szczególnie je polecać."

The reviews were good so we had to try it out for ourselves. The pizzeria is at the top of the building so be ready to climbs some stairs, no elevator sorry. We decided to try some New York pizza. I would have to say this is one of the best pizzas I've had in New York by far.  There are lots to choose from it was hard for us to decide. Since my wife and I could not decide on one they allowed us to do a half-and-half option. My wife wanted the Hawaiian pizza which came with thick pieces of ham and lots of pineapple it was so good. My pizza came with lots of veggies and it was outstanding.  One more thing I had to try was the New York cheesecake. You definitely cannot leave without trying a piece of one of their freshly baked pastries. Everything looks so good and fresh I didn't know what to get. We sat down to eat but if you're on the go they do have fresh pizzas hot and ready for you to grab a slice. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The place was clean and accommodating. I like the fact that they have big windows so you can see the view.  I enjoyed it so much I had to introduce myself to the owner owner and tell him he was going to receive a 5 star rating from me. Make plans if you are in the area, you can't miss out on this place. Also the name says deli and on the bottom of the building is a fine deli which we did not get to try out but I hear is also very good. I guess we will have to leave that 1 for the next visit."

            "text": "Food was good. The bun on the chicken sandwich was a bit dry but the rest was good. The Ruben and the pastrami were warm and juicy. The cook did not understand much English but the main guy was really nice.  We also had pizza, it was\npretty good but came up to almost $12 for 2 slices. Not much of an atmosphere as it is a simple deli so that's why I rated a 3."

Only note is that each of the paninis comes on pita bread - that was a surprise to me.  Other sandwiches have bread options."
