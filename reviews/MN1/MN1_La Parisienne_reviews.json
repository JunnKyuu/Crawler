The coffee was solid too, but the real highlight was the dessert: the chocolate tart with ice cream is a must-try. The staff was friendly and attentive. The only downsides were the size of the space, it can feel quite cramped when crowded and the smell; our clothes held onto the food odors after leaving."

The place is small but super cozy with a nice vibe.\n\nGot the latte and french toast with banana, blueberries, and almond flakes — so good! Soft, not too sweet, and perfect with the coffee. The smoked salmon and avocado toast was fresh and flavorful too — love the combo with lemon and dill.\n\nGreat spot to chill, grab brunch, and enjoy some quality food and coffee. Definitely a hidden gem worth checking out! ☕️💙🥐"

Friendly, appropriately attentive service.  Had only a 5min wait time around 11am on a Sunday.\n\nQuaint, charming atmosphere tucked away in the Financial District.   Very friendly and welcoming, make for a warm welcome.  Although the selection is small I  terms of pastry options, none fail to please!  The soft, yet flaky Apple Choussan is a must.  A solid croissant which speaks to the high quality of the pastries.  The pain au chocolat holds it own, a little lean on the chocolate experience when compared to a Montréal version, yet it will not disappoint.  Indoor and outdoor seating is a plus."

Dude either add a mandatory gratuity on your god damn menu or learn that we do not owe you more than you’ve listed on your menu because you don’t wanna pay your employees a living wage. You’re ruining vacations and once in a decade trips for people who work everyday looking forward to being able to enjoy your city."

            "text": "La Parisienne, located in the heart of the Financial District at 9 Maiden Ln, is a charming little French café that feels like stepping into a slice of Paris amid the busy energy of Wall Street. The space is a bit tight, but that only adds to its cozy, authentic Parisian café feel.\n\nI went with the Salmon Brioche, and it was nothing short of exquisite. The toasted brioche was buttery yet light, carrying layers of smoked salmon, creamy herb ricotta, cucumber, avocado, capers, pickled onion, and fresh dill. It reminded me of how the French approach food quality ingredients prepared simply but with balance and care, letting freshness speak for itself. Brioche, with its rich and pillowy texture, has always been central to French baking, and here it becomes the perfect base for something indulgent yet elegant. Every bite was a harmony of textures and flavors silky, tangy, creamy, and crisp.\n\nMy friend ordered the Avo Toast on multigrain, with miso tahini spread, lemon, scallions, black sesame, and ripe avocado. It was so good that I didn’t even get a chance to snap a picture ,the kind of dish you dive into before your phone comes out. What I loved most was how it felt like a modern, global nod layered on top of a French café tradition. Avocado toast may not be French by origin, but the way it was plated and seasoned reflected that same spirit of refinement and attention to detail you’d find in Paris cafés reinventing classics.\n\nLa Parisienne blends New York energy with timeless French café culture  small tables, artful plates, and food that’s as comforting as it is thoughtful. I’ll absolutely be back to explore more of the menu."

Wir haben dort unser Frühstück genossen und waren begeistert von der Qualität der Croissants, Süssspeisen und auch dem Kaffee.\n\nDie französische Musik im Hintergrund und das Ambiente versetzt einen nach Paris.\n\nAn unserem Tag war es sehr kalt in NYC (April) und leider stand die Türe die ganze Zeit offen. An ein gemütliches Sitzen war daher nicht zu denken.\n\nInsgesamt ist das La Parisienne einen Besuch wert (an einem vielleicht wärmeren Tag). Die Sitzmöglichkeiten sind leider sehr begrenzt."

Although many people were enjoying their signature waffles, we had their salmon brioche sandwich, which was excellent and good value, with a generous serving of salmon. We also had the avocado salad which was great. The americano coffee is also worth ordering. The cafe gets busy sh be sure to reserve ahead & monitor the wait time. Highly recommended."

There is an iPad to sign in on for them to keep track of people looking to dine in. It was PACKED! Very popular but once seated the service to get breakfast was amazing. Ordered the cappuccino and ham and cheese croissant. Take-away was also available if you didn’t want to dine in. Little bistro tables, tightly packed. Felt like a cute Parisian cafe in downtown NYC"

Everything was spot on, except for the matcha latte. It was way too hot to drink at first, and the matcha was so strong it overpowered everything. If they fix that, it would easily be a 5-star spot! Still, definitely worth a visit for the food and overall experience."

            "text": "Went for brunch on a weekday morning.\n\nFirst, the good: The food was amazing. Point blank. Maybe one of the best French toast I've ever had. Croque forestier was rich and roasted to perfection.\n\nNow, the bad: It's a bit hard to enjoy the food because it is WAY too small and gets loud. I get NYC leasing is tough and the establishment probably wants to pack as many tables as they can, but you are literally elbowing one another and talking over the next table. I was hit several times as people awkwardly shuffled around me, and a nearby table even knocked over their glasses as they stood up to leave. Maybe because of the overcrowding, wait staff (who were very kind and polite) seemed a bit overwhelmed. I bet the cooks also felt it, as food took maybe 40 minutes to arrive (2 sandwiches and French toast for two people). We were so hungry and a bit annoyed by then.\n\nConclusion: Lots of potential but def needs to address the overcrowding and long wait times for food before I can recommend it to others."

They said only 15 minutes which I didn’t believe but got Seated in less than 10.\n\nNice vibes with very friendly staff. Intimate atmosphere.\n\nSomewhat limited menu, but the those things they have are vetted.\n\nA a few tables around me got French toast, which looks delicious!\n\nTheir baked goods also were good. Homemade chocolate chip cookies always are go to, and although it was a little too sweet, it was still worth getting."

Only thing to keep in mind is before you go, do put your name on the Yelp waitlist as it gets crowded on the weekend. We ordered avocado toast, almond croissant and a sandwich. Everything tasted really good. They do have a lot of pastry options so do check it out."

Thick slices of brioche with so much flavor. Only downside is that it is a bit cramped in there, though that’s most cafes in nyc. If you need a more accessible seating arrangement, I’d suggest visiting when the weather is nice so you can sit outside. Or try going at a slower time."
