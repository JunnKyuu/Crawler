They propose two different french fries (one classic and one seasonned that i loved) and you can definitely tell they are freshly homemade. Shout out to the cooks for daring to propose seasonned french fries cuz it feels good to try something new and innovative ;) they had quite a nice selection of beers too. My girlfriend had a cider cuz she can t have beers with gluten and that one was perfect. I tried the bloody orange pale ale and once again what a pleasing surprise cuz i haven t tasted once as good as this one.\nBurgers are really tasty"

The food was amazing as well, my dad ordered a burger and loaded fries which didn’t survive for pictures lol. I had garlic Parmesan chicken wings and tots and boy when I say the flavor was there omg definitely top 5 in my book. A new fav of ours will be back, definite recommendation to come here if not for food for the comfort.\n\nPs - Give Elise a raise 😎"

We also ordered bunch of appetizers to share - the wings were delicious with unlimited sauces, the waffle fries and cauliflower tenders were fan favorite as well.

En al het vlees is biologisch en zonder antibiotica en hormonen. Daarna kan je de topping kiezen. Wij kozen de california en de my deer. De burger waren groot, medium gebakken op een brioche. Lekker vlees, pure smaak. We hadden ook normale friet en zoete aardappel friet. Dit kwam in een emmer(tje). Niet die mini emmers van Nederland. Je kan makkelijk 1 emmer delen.  De zoete aardappel leek meer aangebrand  en was donker van kleur en minder zoet en luchtig zoals ik het ken. De curry bij de friet was erg lekker. De lemonade en ice tea waren ook lekker.

            "text": "Doskonałe hamburgery, idealne frytki, pyszna domowa lemoniada, pikle smakowały jak domowe ze słoika od babci. Produkty najwyższej jakości, z ekologicznych dostaw. Obsługa bardzo sympatyczna i komunikatywna, ucięliśmy sobie pogawędkę na temat pochodzenia produktów w restauracji. Miejsce bardzo klimatyczne, typowy amerykański klimat. Bardzo blisko WTC, w sercu Manhattanu a mimo to ceny przystępne. Polecam."

Si sente la differenza.\n\nUn grandissimo punto a favore è il personale: gentilissimi e simpatici, davvero sopra la media. Un ringraziamento speciale a Diana, che ci ha servito con una disponibilità rara: ci ha aiutato nella scelta dei panini e ci ha seguiti con attenzione e gentilezza per tutta la durata del pasto.\n\nIl locale è piacevole e ben curato, perfetto per una cena tra amici. Il prezzo è coerente con la media di New York: noi abbiamo speso circa 130$ in 5, e ne è valsa assolutamente la pena.\n\nConsigliatissimo!"

Each of us tried a different burger and had an order of fries and onion rings. The drinks were amazing. The Rum Punch was like an island in a glass. The Classic Margarita was made with love. Give it a try!"

De postre unos batidos que estaban espectaculares. El servicio rápido y muy amable con especial mención a Adriana que fue nuestra camarera y estuvo muy atenta en todo momento. Imprescindible si visitas o estás en NY!"

The Burger was nice, the toppings and sauces complimented it. Cocktail and Shakes' options were great too.\nOur experience was elevated by the exceptional service. The staff was very courteous and polite.\n\nIn conclusion, Burger Village is a must visit for Burger enthusiasts and those looking for diverse options. Don't miss their array of innovative burgers, beverages and scrumptious sides to compliment your meal"

The young woman with the cute beanie recommended me a great combination of toppings for my bison-burger. Which, in combination with the giant portion of waffle-fries, was too much for my big appetite.\nThe burger was perfectly cooked and the waffle fries… 🤤 I’ll 100% visit again, when I’m in NY again."
