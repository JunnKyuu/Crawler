The wings were crispy, saucy, and packed with flavor (the crunchy garlic + scallions were everything 🥹🔥). The crab rangoon were some of the best I’ve had, cheesy, creamy, and loaded with real crab. 🦀💛\n\nThe curry crab? Immaculate. We absolutely demolished it. The Khao Man Gai (tender poached chicken with rice) was a comforting classic …simple yet soulful, especially when eaten fresh. 🍗🍚 The Pad Thai leaned sweeter and nutty with the peanuts, not totally my vibe, but definitely still fresh and authentic.\n\nPairing it all with a crisp Thai beer just sealed the night. 🍺🌶️ Truly a cozy spot for when you’re craving bold flavors and comfort all on one table."

The old-style decor creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, making it a perfect spot for an authentic Thai meal.\nThe Pad Thai was made in true Thai street food style—flavorful, perfectly balanced, and not overly sweet like many other places. The Rib Red Curry was absolutely amazing! The ribs were tender, and the red curry sauce was rich, aromatic, and packed with bold flavors. Another must-try is the Fresh Roll with Tofu, which was light, refreshing, and paired beautifully with the dipping sauce.\nIf you’re looking for a spot with real Thai flavors in a cozy setting, this is definitely worth checking out. Highly recommend!"

I especially loved the Pad Thai or Kra Pao, which was perfectly spiced and cooked to perfection. The ingredients tasted fresh, and the presentation was spot-on. What made the experience even better was the fantastic service. The staff were friendly, attentive, and quick to ensure we had everything we needed. The atmosphere was welcoming, and I left feeling satisfied and eager to return. Highly recommend this spot to anyone craving delicious Thai cuisine with a side of excellent hospitality!"
