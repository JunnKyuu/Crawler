When it finally arrived, both bagels were burnt, and our French toast order never came. It’s frustrating because everything looks delicious, but the kitchen’s pace really takes away from the experience. If you’re not in a rush, maybe you won’t mind... but it wasn’t for us."

Auch The Avo war kreativ belegt und sehr aromatisch. Der Iced Macchiato war für US-Verhältnisse gut, der Orangensaft kam aus der Flasche, war aber dennoch lecker.\n\n🥣 Portionen & Preis: Ausreichend und sättigend – keine Schnäppchen, aber für Manhattan absolut im Rahmen.\n\n🕰️ Service: Schnell und freundlich, allerdings fühlten wir uns am Ende etwas zum Bezahlen gedrängt – schade, da noch ein Kaffee geplant war.\n\n🪑 Ambiente: Modern und gemütlich – mit Sitzplätzen im Inneren, angenehm ruhig und stilvoll gestaltet.\n\n🔁 Fazit: Wer im Financial District ein kreatives, geschmacklich hochwertiges Frühstück sucht, ist hier genau richtig. Empfehlenswert für Foodies und Kaffeeliebhaber gleichermaßen."

            "text": "I am so glad to have discovered this gem!!!! Alex and his team are super lovely and the food + coffee were all incredible!\n\nCoffee was AMAZING - dark roast that was full-bodied, incredibly smooth, with pleasant toffee and caramel notes.\n\nI ordered the Ranchero which appears to be on of the more popular items on the menu. The slow cooked brisket was incredibly tender and just a bit spicy from the thinly sliced red chilis. All the elements on the plate worked perfectly together and I left feeling satisfied.\n\nThe space is cozy without feeling cramped. It wasn't too busy when I visited but I'll suspect a wait once word gets out about this place.\n\nEnjoyed my experience here and I can't wait to come back to try the other food items!! :)"

            "text": "Regular NYC is a true gem in the FiDi area, offering excellent food and coffee in a cozy, welcoming setting. The staff is exceptionally friendly, making the visit a pleasant experience.\n\nWe tried the Benny Ruben and the brisket sandwich, both of which were very flavorful with interesting tastes and quite filling. The hash browns were perfectly made—not too burnt or oily—and had great flavor.\n\nI also had an oat latte, which was amazing. It was full-bodied and not sour, unlike what I've experienced at many other cafes.\n\nOverall, Regular NYC stands out as a must-visit spot for anyone in the area, combining great food, excellent coffee, and friendly service in a delightful environment."

            "text": "Nice little spot to grab some coffee or their well made matcha latte. They had some great options but i picked the beagal, which was hard and not delicious at all, so i just had to get a dessert to polish it off on top. The chocolate cookie was decent and well baked. Kind of pricey, but it could be because im no longer a new yorker."

            "text": "THE BEST breakfast sandwich in NYC. The bacon, egg and cheese with hash brown on an everything bagel is worth coming down from the Bronx for. And the Ranchero is equally worth the trip. Anything with the brisket is a win to be honest. It’s slow-cooked and to die for. The coffee is also really good…noticeably different than most coffee spots. It actually tastes like coffee (I drink mine black without sugar) rather than whatever the acidic brown water Starbucks and Dunkin serve is. The staff is also super friendly and accommodating. Extra special shoutout to the owner, Alex. He goes above and beyond to make sure the customer experience is top tier, and in an age of absentee owners he’s engaged in running the business alongside his employees and it shows."

            "text": "This is that one local place you cannot go wrong with. 10/10 y’all, I’m obsessed with this restaurant. I had the AVO sourdough dish and it was beautiful in every way. I tried my family’s dishes too and it was all mouthwatering. Everything just tasted fresh and homemade. I officially had the best latte ever, I decided to go with the Waitress’s go-to which is an almond milk Mocha latte with cinnamon 🙌🏽 so thick and buttery like. Speaking of the waitress we had Gia and I’m obsessed with her, literally made the experience top tier with her friendliness and knowledge. Her personality is so beautiful and she makes you feel so welcomed. Prices are very reasonable. Love love love this place 😌"
