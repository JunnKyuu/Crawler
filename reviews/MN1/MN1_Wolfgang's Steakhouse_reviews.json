            "text": "Experience and meal certainly did not live up to the price and name. Ordered the porterhouse and while decent, could not compare to competitors’ within the price range (Empire Steakhouse etc.). Tuna and fillet mignon was decent and portions were good. Service, however, needs to be greatly improved, especially for a steakhouse at this price point. Bread was served cold and when asked, the server simply dismissed it. Plates were thrown on to the table, no explanation of the sauces/dishes were given and the server felt unhappy to serve our table in general. Automatic 20% tip was still included in the bill but we did not agree to it given the lacklustre service. Gentleman at the front of house however was cheery, helpful and welcoming."

But the food was phenomenal!! We ordered oysters, lobster soup, mozzarella and tomatoes, porter house steak, filet mignon, cream spinach, potatoes, and lobster Mac and cheese. For dessert we had a little bit of everything. The steak was seasoned so well, it was the best steak I have had in a long time. Everything was amazing! Alfred was our waiter and he was so attentive, and patient in answering all of our questions, we felt so comfortable with him and at home. Will definitely be coming back!"

Children were running all over, loud parties, long wait for the service these are some of the things you will find there. Regarding the food - ordered a salad and fillet mignion and both were OK and nothing outstanding. The service was a a real horrible expereince. Waiters are very angry and clearly did not want to be there. They rushed the party with the service, pulling plates while someone in the party who is a slow eater was trying to slice the meet, were generally rude. Never explained about the menue options. It was really a horrible expereince. Never again."

I thought the mashed potatoes and Caesar salad were side dish of the steak but now I see they were added separately on the receipts. Foods taste good, BV Cabernet Sauvignon Napa valley  red wine was excellent. The server was kind too. The only problem was we ordered too much portion for 2 people. I dare not even think about beef steak for 2 months afterwards lol\nHudson River Park is nearby. We took a stroll there after the meal. This restaurant is in Tribeca area. Good to look around.\n\nSirloin steak와 Rib eye steak를 주문하고 매쉬 포테이토와 시저 샐러드를 주문했다. 매쉬 포테이토와 시저샐러드는 사이드디쉬인 줄 알았는데 영수증에 별도로 가격이 적혀 있음. 음식 맛이 좋았고 BV의 나파벨리 카베르네 쇼비뇽 레드와인 맛이 아주 좋았다. 서버도 친절했는데, 문제는 주문한 양이 남녀 둘이서 먹기에 너무 많이서 이후로 두 달 간 스테이크는 쳐다보기도 싫었다는 것 🤣\n허드슨 리버파크가 주변에 있어서 식사후 산책하기 좋다. 트라이베카 지역에 있어서 둘러보기 좋음"

I had a cocktail, which was well-crafted and honestly the highlight of the evening.\nI ordered the filet mignon with a side of mashed potatoes—surprisingly, the side wasn’t included and came at an extra cost. The mashed potatoes were creamy and comforting, but the steak was on the dry side. The sauce helped, but it didn’t quite make up for the lack of flavor.\nOverall, not a terrible dining experience, but food-wise it didn’t stand out. I won’t be rushing back anytime soon."

Obsługa przyjazna oraz  klimat jest świetny.\nNa przystawkę zamówiliśmy, pomidora z cebulą i blue cheese sauce - nie myślałem, że to będzie takie dobre. Pomidor 🍅\nsoczysty, pełen smaku (nie wodnisty) a cebula🧅 bardzo lekka, nie miała intensywnego posmaku cebuli. Do tego blue cheese sauce dodaje smaku i „łączy składniki”.\nNa drugie danie, wzięliśmy ogromnego steka🥩 z ziemniaki 🥔 i szpinakiem. Pycha! Stek soczysty, pełen smaku i idealnie usmażony…. Ziemniaki z cebulką też pyszne wraz ze szpinakiem.\nNa zakończenie naszej „kulinarnej podróży” wzięliśmy ciasto czekoladowe z bitą śmietaną na spółkę - też przepyszne!\nJak ktoś chce zjeść najlepszego steka 🥩 w NYC, to to jest to miejsce!\nPolecam;)"

Die Steaks und Fische waren sehr gut zubereitet, aber viel zu große Portionen, die vermutlich die hohen Preise rechtfertigen sollen. Die Beilagen waren in Ordnung. Was allerdings unterirdisch war, war der Service. Alle 3 Kellner, die uns bedient hatten, haben uns alles eher auf den Tisch geworfen, anstatt es elegant abzulegen. Die Klimaanlage war dauerhaft an und wir hatten teilweise unsere Jacken an. Auf Nachfrage wurde uns gesagt dass man die Temperatureinstellung nicht ändern konnte.\nInsgesamt war das Essen gut, aber der Service bei über 1.000$ Rechnung nicht akzeptabel."

If it was a 2.5 pounder I would be surprised. They served it already opened and out of shell. I was shocked they had the audacity to pull a fast one like they pulled. Wolfgang is a very well respected restaurant that we go to when family is in town.\nTruly it makes me not want to patronize them any longer. The thick bacon app was amazing. The Fillet wasn’t melt in your mouth but seasoned well. The baked clams were very good.\nI just can’t get over the lobster."

            "text": "Heard a lot about Wolfgang’s, but it was my first time. I thought it was a luxury steakhouse but it was actually quite “civil”. Spacious and cozy interior. Our waiter seemed a little “mechanical” at the beginning, talking like a robot, but it turned out he was actually a nice guy. Steak (Porterhouse) was among the top ones I had in NYC. Also the sides were pretty good (even though a lot of garlic, we had some problems sleeping afterwards). Recommended."

Mediocre service, food was up to par, but not exceptional (I ordered lump crab meat and it was good, but as a Maryland girl I like great). The bass I ate was very nice and I enjoyed the lobster Mac and cheese. The steak for three was huge for a table of five. Oh, and they don't warm their bread so there's that... otherwise it's a suitable late-night dining option"

When our third guest arrived then they were consistently checking and waiting on us, granted myself and my mother had never been here but our family friend that invited us is a regular. I don’t know if them knowing who our family friend was changed the tone of the service but before they arrived it was mediocre.\n\nLove the details of the ceiling and the history of the restaurants inception."

Posso dire che la location è favolosa e la carne di qualità molto superiore a quella Italiana. I prezzi non sono economici per standard italiani ma per la grande mela sono più che onesti. I ragazzi della sala sono professionali e preparati. Voglio fare un ringraziamento ad Albert il capo sala che ci ha consigliato nel migliore dei modi addirittura consigliandoci di non ordinare troppe portate che non avremmo finito."

            "text": "First, I need to just say WOW. The absolute best steak I have ever had. Myself and 2 friends went to celebrate our July Birthdays. We started with a couple of cocktails which were great. Appetizers were one piece of thick cut bacon, 1/2 dozen oysters and fresh tomato and mozzarella. The bacon, which they cut into thirds, was incredible. Nice crisp on outside, juicy on inside with the perfect amount of fat. Oysters were super fresh and clean. The mozzarella was perfect consistency and tomato's were sweet. Porterhouse for 3 was cooked rare, as ordered. It was rare throughout with a nice char on the outside. The oil they use to cook on the plate was spectacular. We all dipped the pieces into it. Sides were creamed spinach, which was a vibrant green and delicious, German potatoes, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, and lobster Mac and cheese which had huge chunks of lobster. Dessert was tartufo, which I never order and it was delicious, and pecan pie. Both came with home made whipped cream, or schlag. It was super thick and cut the sweetness.  The service was attentive without hovering and the room is beautiful. I can't wait for another special occasion or for me to get a job where I can afford to go every week."

Drinks were perfect. Service was good but they did forget several things. And it was extremely loud. But all in all we had a great time. I would recommend the Park ave. location."

From there Seafood Tower which tastes fresh and well prepared to there Sizzling Canadian Bacon it’s all delicious. All the sides we order are sharable and tasty. And do I have to say this again,,that Wolfgangs Steaks are absolutely amazing and definitely top 3 if not #1 in all New York. Drinks are always on point at Wolfgangs.\n2 - Service 3/5 GOOD.  Drinks were delivered fast and correctly. Not so engaging waitstaff and table took way too long to be cleared considering the tables are very small and tightly packed.\n3 - Ambiance 3/5. GOOD. Seated in the bar area didn’t seem fitting what I consider fine ding especially because we had reservations. This area looks to be for last minute drop in diners. Very cold night and there is a considerable draft when the door opens up in this bar room area. Probably would think higher of this location if we sat in the main dining room instead of there tightly squeezed in bar room.\n4 - Reservations 5/5 EXCELLENT. Same day made. Not too busy this place I guess.\n5 - Value  3/5. GOOD. Prices are always reasonable at Wolfgangs considering this is a top notch Steakhouse. We prefer there park Ave and there 37th street location better for reasons stated. Probably would return and more than likely, I  will NOT recommend for now."
