However, i was hesitant to after seeing the B health review on the door. The servers were inattentive to me and my friends. We constantly had to get their attention to place our order, ask for water/refills, and after receiving our order they didn’t check up on us once. The food itself was decent but the service was horrible. They weren’t even that busy to ignore us. For that reason I wouldn’t come back. We were fed up to the point where when we were ready to pay and leave it took them over 15 mins to get the check from us so we had to get up and go to the front ourselves. I wouldn’t go back here again."

The BBQ was flavorful, especially the spiced pork belly, though the portion sizes were on the smaller side. A staff member handled the grilling for us and cooked the meat perfectly.

            "text": "One of the amazing restaurants in Lower Manhattan! We visited for my friend's birthday lunch. The atmosphere is so chic and modern. The decor is decent, and they have spacious tables for bigger groups. We indulged in fantastic cocktails such as margaritas, Manhattan, old-fashioned, and appletini, all expertly crafted and definitely strong. Our order included the Gunbae Hansang combo, veggie bibimbap, and Dduk Mandu Guk soup with veggie dumplings and vegetables - everything was scrumptious and delightful. A staff member even came to our table to prepare the BBQ for the combo, which was a fantastic experience. My friends and I had a wonderful time, and although they close at 3 pm, they didn't rush us; we left at 3:15. To top it off, they surprised us with a small ice cream topped with a candle to celebrate my friend's birthday. Excellent service, delicious food, and a nice place for Korean cuisine!"
