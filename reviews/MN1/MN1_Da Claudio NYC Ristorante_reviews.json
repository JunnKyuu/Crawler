And increase quality focus of each.\n\nAs example service staff were sharing all jobs but taking orders. Which meant I got grated cheese offer 2 minutes after I already got my food (just example).\n\nKitchen was organized and timely."

Only food item that was good was the crème brûlée. Staff was friendly, and let us sit 20 mins before closing. Probably the reason food was not great. Visited oct 16th.\nFood prices were fair, but wine prices were aggressive. Starting price for a glass of wine was 17 (18 for red). Atmosphere was good enough for a date."

            "text": "Yes, Manhattan is home to hundreds of Italian restaurants, and yes, you’ll stumble upon thousands of spots serving pasta, pizza, and wine. But there is only ONE place where you’re welcomed with the kind of warmth, generosity, and attention that makes you feel less like a guest and more like family: Da Claudio.\n\nFrom the moment you step inside, there’s a noticeable difference. The team greets you not with formality, but with genuine hospitality, remembering faces, recalling preferences, and making every guest feel as if their table is the most important one in the room. In a city where service can sometimes feel rushed or transactional, this level of personal care is rare and unforgettable.\n\nThe food itself is both comforting and contemporary. Classic Italian dishes are elevated with modern touches, seasonal ingredients, and a level of execution that shows the kitchen takes pride in every plate.\n\nBut Da Claudio isn’t just about the food or the drinks, it’s about the feeling. It’s the warmth of the staff, the buzz of conversation, the balance between casual and elegant. It’s knowing that no matter how many restaurants New York may offer, there’s one place you can always return to and count on a memorable evening. The food may be the icing on the cake, but it’s the heart of the people behind Da Claudio... Linda, Claudio and their staff... that makes it a treasure."

The warm, inviting atmosphere made a great place for dinner with friends.\n\nIt was great to see female bartender/mixologists. The margaritas were bright and perfectly balanced, and the Negroni Da Claudio was a standout—smooth, well-crafted, and with just the right bitterness.\n\nFor dinner, the Wagyu Lasagna was nothing short of indulgent. Layers of tender, flavorful wagyu beef with just the right amount of sauce and cheese created a decadent twist on the classic comfort dish. It’s a must-try for any pasta lover.\n\nDa Claudio delivers on all fronts: great cocktails, memorable dishes, and a warm, intimate vibe. Definitely a place I’ll be returning to soon."

Owner is attentive and servers are effervescent. Starting at the bar, there are incredible cocktails and a very nice wine selection.\n\nThe pasta is what I DREAM about though. I find myself craving the spaghetti carbonara and fusilli cacio e pepe with a side of their wonderful bread. Another favorite is the tagliata strip steak, always perfectly cooked to order. The restaurant has a nice rotating list of specials in addition to their solids. I hope the veal scallopini comes back soon!"

Bread nice and soft too.\n\nLasagna had good taste but had no structure that lasagna should have.

I read a lot of reviews before visiting and their pastas didn’t look quite appealing so we only got the black linguine which was okay.\n\nBurrata\nThe best dish out of everything we ordered. You’d often see Burrata with tomatoes or prosciutto but this came with beets and quinoa. I was never really of a fan of quinoa because i felt like it didn’t how it tasted but this one was amazing. The sauce matched very well with everything.\n\nPolipo $23\nThe overall taste was nice. Would have been better if they cooked it a bit less or longer because it was pretty chewy. Stayed in my mouth for quite some time.\n\nBlack linguine $28\nA note for those considering, the pasta sauce isn’t squid ink but the pasta itself contains squid ink. So the good side is that it wont get all messy and black but for those who like the squid ink sauce, it’s not the same.\nThe pasta has a strong taste itself so i felt like the tomato sauce and squid ink pasta kinda stood out on their own a bit too much. Didn’t quite feel the fusion that they were going for. It would’ve been nicer if they put a little slit on the prawns so that it was easier for us to eat too.\n\nLasagna $26\nThey bring the lasagna in a warm plate and then shedder cheese on top of that. It was a good warm dish but the portion was fairly small so you may want to order 1 for every 2 people.\n\nSorbetto (blood orange & pear) $8\nYou get to choose 2 out of 3 options (blood orange, lemon and pear)\nThe blood orange was not too sour nor sweet which made the pear sweetness stand out even more. The pear one was just to sweet. If you’re getting the sorbet because you don’t want a too sweet desert, blood orange and lemon may be the 2 options for you."

We sat down at the bar, started with one of their cocktails and order some nibbles, picture is of our burrata. I had then the Carbonara (authentic!) and my friend had the Calamarata pasta which was absolutely favolosa, we matched it with a very tasty Nero d’Avola!!! Wine list is big and all towards substainable wines. Thank you to Eugene for the cocktails and sensational service!!! Will be back soon and can only recommended!"
