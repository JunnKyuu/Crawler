Soup dumplings had thick skin and little flavor, sichuan mushroom dumplings were again not flavorful, beef shumai was not good at all. Only redeeming factor was the fried spare ribs, which I’ll admit were a 10/10 amazing. But one dish out of five is scary. I’ve lived in China and visited Hong Kong multiple times… idk how to describe this place. At least it’s affordable and fast."

The tofu I got was extremely soft (I'm a fan of soft tofu) and I ordered it with mild spice (because my poor taste buds don't have that much spice tolerance), which was the perfect level for me! The fish was also fresh, and I asked for a lighter fare on my palate with less oil which they did do for me. Even though I'm not a huge fan of seafood, man, that fish was good. (It's also an inside joke that an Asian restaurant is authentic if it comes with its own aquarium that hosts all the seafood XD). The decoration and atmosphere was also really cozy, with nice lighting and beautiful art."

It’s $70 for not cooking it right! I regretted not complaining and kept thinking about why I'm paying so much for a dish that's done wrong! Servers never checked back with us if everything was alright! Too much corn starch and salt on some veg dishes. Eat dim sum if there.\n\nResponse to your answer:\nI’m well aware of how this dish look and taste. Your link is exactly how it should be, but that’s not what was served! I wish I took a picture. The crab served has a thick fried batter like fish and chips and served very dry with dry onions. Didn’t taste anything like Bei Fung Tong crab! No resemblance to the picture in your link!

Our server Tony(if I remember correctly) was amazing. He was very knowledgeable and explained the whole menu to us. Everything he recommended was fantastic. Our favorite dish was the crispy shredded beef. I would definitely come back and recommend to others."

I’m not naive—I understand my own culture deeply as a Cantonese person, and I know the difference between a bad day and blatant disregard.\n\nThe service was horrendous: muttering curses in Cantonese while serving, barely speaking to us, no greeting, no warmth. Yet, the Caucasian guests next to us were welcomed with smiles and attentive service. The contrast was undeniable.\n\nNevertheless, I will not spend my money where it isn’t wanted. So we walked out."

I went solo and saw other solo dinners too! It is on one of the side streets, but close to the Fulton Center train station if you don’t want to drive as parking is challenging in the City.\nThey had a vast selection of items to choose from, but I couldn’t go all out as it was only me, to try more items go with a group,However the ones I selected were sumptuous. The prices for the dim sum and regular menu items weren’t too over the top.\nI am big on customer service so wasn’t too satisfied with the young male server who attended to me, but there was another older gentleman who worked there who was attentive and asked if I was good, probably because he saw me taking pics. He may have figured I was going to Review somewhere. So service could be improved.\nFood was good and I would definitely go back when feeling for Dim Sum again!"

While a few dishes stood out - like the XO fried turnip cake and seafood pea shoot dumplings - the overall dim sum quality was just okay; the pan-fried tiny buns were disappointing - they were barely fried and not crispy at all. The entree menu also felt somewhat limited in terms of traditional Cantonese offerings. It’s a convenient spot for dim sum in FiDi, though Chinatown offers a wider variety of options just a short distance away."

The menu made it sound like something out of a culinary dream: succulent, tender meat with crispy skin that melts in your mouth. I was sold. My mouth was watering before I even sat down, visions of perfectly roasted duck dancing in my head. But when the plate finally arrived, my enthusiasm quickly turned to confusion, then to sorrow. What I was presented with wasn’t a duck—it was more like a duck skeleton. More bones than a cemetery, and less meat than a chicken wing at a Super Bowl party.\n\nI stared at the plate in disbelief, poking around to see if, by some miracle, there was more meat hidden under the carnage. No such luck. The duck had been picked cleaner than a crime scene. I’m not saying I was expecting a lot, but I was at least hoping for something I could sink my teeth into, not just a collection of future soup stock. Maybe this was a culinary test, I thought. Perhaps they wanted me to appreciate the artistry of bone presentation. Or maybe, just maybe, they had run out of meat and hoped I wouldn’t notice.\n\nPro tip: if you ever find yourself in the same predicament, make sure to specify that you’d like meat *with* your bones. Unless, of course, you’re into nibbling around the edges like a vulture. Otherwise, the only thing you’ll leave with is a deeper appreciation for soup broth—and a profound sense of culinary disappointment."

We came around 1 pm lunch hour peak time, we only ordered egg tart and we had to wait for a long time. The egg tarts were were already cooked and ready.  But because we want to try it, we waited. Just be careful to rude costumers who will skip the line because they speak the language.  One lady with the nyp scrubs with Physical therapist uniform name literally skipped me and she spoke their language and the cashier didnt correct her right away and that she needs to go at the back as there are other people behind me."

In a few minutes, one of the staff placed the bag of food on the table too close to my plate. I was still having my lunch. I did think it was too close but didn't make a fuss. Within seconds, my server came over, took the bag, tucked in the handles, and placed the bag in the corner away from my space. It is very much appreciated! Food was also delicious, and the black truffle dumplings were perfect."

We had took advantage of their promotion and ordered whole peaking duck, lobster and salmon caviar fried rice. When the foods arrive, people been asking us what are those? We told them we had ordered their promotions dishes. Other people started to follow us and ordered their promotions dishes as well. When our bill came, someone had messed up and charged us full price. Luckily we saw that and had let them know. They had apologize and straighten things out for us. We will go back and order the other 3 dishes which is Vancouver crab, truffle fried rice and lives sea bass."
