My partner said her parmigiana was Luke warm before I mentioned mine tasted of too much vinegar. Had to write this review because I know they can do better. Staff didn’t ask how the food was. Maybe the staff know it’s not up to scratch."

Sauce that actually tastes like someone gave a damn. Cheese…gooey, molten, stretching like a phone line you don’t want to answer.\n\nThis isn’t Naples. It’s not some “heritage grain, hand milled by monks” nonsense. It’s New York. Big, messy, unapologetic. You grab a slice, grease slicks your fingers, and suddenly you’re ten years old again, sitting on a stoop, burning the roof of your mouth, and not caring.\n\nAdrienne’s doesn’t want to be your Instagram moment. It’s not gonna wink at you, not gonna kiss your ass. It’s gonna feed you. And maybe that’s all a pizza joint should ever do.\n\nThe crowd? Suits who think they discovered fire. Tourists who read about it in a guidebook. Locals who knew before the rest. Doesn’t matter. The pie’s the same. Solid. Square. No bullshit.\n\nNew York’s filled with pizza hustlers, glossy facades, overpriced slices that taste like regret. Adrienne’s? It delivers the thing. Hot, square, real. You walk out with sauce on your shirt and beer still on your breath. That’s the win."

We ordered the Original Old-Fashioned Square. The crust was great, and the sauce was tasty — though in some parts there was a bit too much sauce, which made those areas of the pizza soggy. But the cheese and toppings were fresh and delicious.\n\nThe main downside was the men’s restroom. It wasn’t clean, and the floor was wet and slippery. If it was water, there should have been a caution sign. And if it was something else, it should’ve been cleaned right away. That part took away from an otherwise enjoyable visit.\n\nStill, overall a good experience."

The bread is like their pizza dough—airy and soft in the middle with a crisp exterior, almost like focaccia. Meatballs are delish too.\n\nIt was a rainy day, so Stone St was pretty dead, and we just walked in at 12:30.

I said “no? If you’re asking then why would I just be ok with that?” To which the response was “oh too bad we’re canceling it anyway, I was just trying to be nice” and eventually hung up on me with zero effort to at least acknowledge that its their fault or take any responsibility.

But when you taste their pizzas you know why. These folks know what they’re doing!\n\nI go there now and again and Adrienne’s never disappoints. This time around I got a half of the Original Old-fashioned Square. I got it with added pepperoni and it was very good. I also got the Chicken Wings Scarpariello, which was amazing! Hot and spicy.\n\nAside from the food, another reason that I like this place so much is because the atmosphere is very chilled and comfortable. This is a great date night destination. Great place to talk and relax with your special friend. I’ve been a fan of Adrienne’s for quite some time and I’ll keep coming back. Strongly recommended!"

They easily seat individuals or groups, albeit an adjustable wait for group sizes.\n\nTheir pizzas (half cheese & mushroom/pepperoni and spinach & crushed/dried tomatoes) feed our group with plenty to spare. The salads, three different, offered ample serving for interested couples or a hungry human. We also ordered the eggplant parmesan and a broccoli side dish, neither of which I tried.\n\nThe service (Eduardo) did a splendid job to make our dining experience relaxing and enjoyable, never letting our water bottle near empty (until the end). As expected, they included gratuity with the group seating. Thanks again, Eduardo AND the Adrienne's Pizzabar Crew!"

            "text": "Initially we went here for lunch and placed the order. Within the next 5 mins, we realised that we had miscalculated the time and our ferry to the Statue of Liberty was in the next 15 mins. It was impossible for us to have the pizza and reach there on time. So we requested if the order could be cancelled and we were ready to pay for the whole order. The server came back saying the pizzas were nearly ready and would be there soon. But since we didn’t not a single minute to spare, we requested to get us the bill and we would pay and go without the pizzas. To our pleasant surprise, they did not charge us at all understanding our issue. This really touched us.\n\nAfter our ferry was back, we went to this place again on the same day , this time for Dinner :)\n\nGood pizzas. We went for the traditional square pizzas. They have good customization options of half and full pizzas. We went for pepperoni and sausage on one side, mushrooms and spicy peppers on the other half. Felt the pepperoni half was a bit salty for my taste. Veggie half of the pizza was good but was a little sour.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and remembered us from the afternoon. We asked them to charge us for both the lunch that we missed and the dinner. But they were very courteous and charged only for the dinner.\n\nWill highly recommend this place!"

Die Pizza war supergut und der Service war auch sehr gut. Wir hatten alle eine super Zeit und haben den Service und das Essen sehr genossen."

            "text": "Came here with friends from Europe who were craving NYC pizza.\nThe pizzas here are absolutely delicious plus there are other items on the menu including salads and pasta so not everyone has to eat pizza. The pizzas, btw, are huge (even the half portion-sizes). We ordered quattro formaggi, the four seasons (my fave!!) and the Original Old Fashioned with add-ons of pepperoni and onions.  I had not been here before but several friends suggested it when I asked for recommendations for great pizza spots that also take reservations. I had one minor issue with the service. My friend and I both ordered wine: he had a glass of prosecco, I had a glass of pinot grigio. Halfway through our meal, I reordered my wine but was served prosecco. After one sip, I told the server she had delivered the wrong wine. she was miffed. They finally took the prosecco away when they saw I would not drink it and delivered the pinot. I was treating my friends and paid without giving the check too much of a review but today I did look and they had charged me for the extra prosecco that I had not ordered as well as for the second pinot grigio. It's not a big deal but leaves a bit of a bad taste."
