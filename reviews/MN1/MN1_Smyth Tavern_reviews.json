I ordered the burger with truffle fries, and while my order initially came out wrong, the staff was incredibly apologetic and quick to fix it. They not only replaced my order right away but also brought out an extra order of fries with it, which I thought was such a thoughtful touch.\n\nThe food was delicious, the service was attentive, and the atmosphere makes you want to linger. Highly recommend this spot if you’re in the area!"

The dinner menu is unfortunately a bit limited, but everything that we got was very good. The chicken paillard salad was delicious- the chicken was super thinly pounded, and there was lots of shaved parm on top. The campanelle alla vodka was amazing and came with fresh burrata on top. The burger and fries were also highly recommended. And the chocolate cake and hot fudge sundae for dessert were a must. The ambiance is cute and relaxing, and the service was good. The prices are in line with the area (which is on the higher side,) but definitely come for happy hour."

The salmon melted in my mouth with a delicate explosion of flavor.\n\nThe salmon was the star of the entree, as it should be, with the potatoes and sting beans adding good quality and tasty additions.\n\nThe chicken soup had a robust flavor and was well made. The service was over the top, maybe because it was not too crowded. At least four different people checked in on me while dining. Every server was polite and professional. Dawn is very charming.\nThe place is extremely clean which I love as a cleanliness nut.\n\nI had the lunch special which was the soup and salmon entree for $28. For this part of the city, during inflationary times seems like a good deal for a scrumptious lunch.\n\nHigh quality food, pleasant atmosphere and great service!\n\nI almost forgot, when I was finished with my meal the waitress brought over a complimentary chocolate chip cookie. Nice touch!"

            "text": "Returning to The Smyth Tavern in Tribeca after some time felt like a rediscovery of an old favorite. From the moment I walked in, the ambiance struck the perfect balance between casual and sophisticated. The window banquette seating adds a cozy touch, while the bar and back dining area provide a more refined atmosphere for a full dinner experience.\nThis visit was all about wine and appetizers with a friend, and we were in for a treat. We started with a bottle of rosé, which set the tone for a relaxed evening. Our first appetizer, the Brussels sprouts with bacon, was an absolute standout. The crispy bacon and perfectly caramelized top layer of the sprouts added an irresistible crunch, making each bite a delight.\nWe also tried the deviled eggs;a classic dish, but I found the portion a bit small for the price, perhaps due to the rising cost of eggs. That said, they were still well-executed. The guacamole was fresh and enjoyable, though not the most memorable dish of the night.\nThe highlight of our meal was the crispy tuna, recommended by our wonderful waitress, Yolanda. She was charismatic and professional, effortlessly upselling us on the wine while also guiding us toward this incredible dish. The crunchy texture on top combined with the flavorful sauce made for an explosion of taste..an absolute must-try.\nAnother standout was the service. Dawn, the manager, was exceptional. She made her rounds, checking in on every table, ensuring that guests felt valued. Her warm and attentive approach elevated the entire experience.\nOverall, The Smyth Tavern has certainly stepped up its game since my last visit. The food, atmosphere, and service were all top-notch. While some prices might feel a little high, the quality and experience more than justify it. Overall a 5 stars !"

            "text": "This place far exceded my expectations. As a single disabled person they understood my needs. No steps to climb and besides a bathroom on the lower level there's one on the restaurant level.\nThe place has a modern bohemian vibe. Tons of beautiful art work adorn the place. Plenty of Sepia and Black and White Photographs honoring NYC's many Water Tanks.\nThe Tavern is attached to and part of the Smyth Hotel which, in my opinion is very swank!\nThey had a special Thanksgiving Day Menu, I went traditional.\nIt's moderately priced.\nVery easy to get there! Take the number 2 train to Chambers Street exit at the SE Corner and you're right at the front door, how convenient is that?\nThe Trade Tower is a short walking distance away.\nI had a window seat that overlooked a Hopper Like Building.\nI may go back for Christmas!"

They literally took pasta barely cooked it al dente and then threw string beans, asparagus, and mushrooms in it. No salt, no butter, no cheese, nothing."

It wasn't packed and I was able to be seated right away.\n\nYolanda was my server and was an absolute gem. She was able to accommodate me by grabbing the breakfast menu. I ordered an orange juice and a Belgian waffle with no Nutella (wasn't in the mood for sweets).\n\nThe orange juice tasted fresh, though the portion felt slightly small considering the $7 price tag. The waffle itself was enjoyable, especially with the addition of fresh berries. However, there was a slight delay in receiving the warm syrup I requested, and by the time it arrived, the waffle had cooled down.\n\nIn all, I can recommend Smyth Tavern for a breakfast date, or solo date. If you do go, ask for Yolanda! She is very attentive and accommodating!\n\nThe postcards with the bill were a nice touch!\n\nThank you for having me!"

The food was delicious, ordered the burrata- heirloom tomato special and branzino st. tropez; as well as the drinks, got the Barbie cocktail. Tish also treated us to one of their amazing desserts, the chocolate 7 layer cake and freshly baked chocolate chip cookies 😍. Can’t wait to go back!"

As I strolled through the restaurant the decor was breath taking and I felt like I was in a upscale modern tavern. As I began with the fried calamari it was delectable and I could not eat it fast enough. The service was absolutely thrilling. My water glass was always filled and the waiter left us with the perfect amount of time to make our food choices. I opted for the Bash Burger. My taste buds were absolutely tickled. I was left smiling and satisfied. I will definitely be dining at this fine establishment again very soon."

We took 8 guests to dinner and the food was good but it seemed like the servers had better things to do than look after us properly. They were pushy about taking orders befor we sipped our for cocktails then they didn’t seem to understand starters come before main course the worst was our wine finally arrived after we had finished our main course.\nSuddenly it made sense why the large dining room was empty, someone isn’t paying attention to the service.\nThe wait staff seemed sweet but had little idea about good service. They should go intern up the street at Odeon."

We ordered the broiled oysters with garlic breadcrumbs and the Smyth burger. The oysters were barely warm, had way too much breadcrumb topping and tasted like a mouthful of mush. We returned them. We ordered the burger medium rare and it arrived raw and cold in the middle. The waiter was very gracious about everything and took it back, but the new burger arrived medium. We ate it, but it wasn't anything special and it certainly wasn't medium rare.\nThe kitchen needs to get its act together. We certainly will not recommend it or eat there again."
