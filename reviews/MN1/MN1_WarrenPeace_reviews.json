Would highly recommend for a drink (or two or three) out in the city. Pistachio Crème Brûlée was delicious too. Didn’t have any other food but everything on the menu looked tasty. Extra points for the Albanian derived menu!"

As it is a small menu, it all needs to be perfect.\n\nThe first miss was the scampi pasta being unavailable - pretty poor when there are only 5 mains on the menu. The second was the lobster croquets are all potato and zero lobster. The crab cakes were pretty good.\n\nThe burger was good, but the waffle fries were under cooked. My steak ordered rare was mostly medium.\n\nOverall a nice place but the food needs work. If you are going to offer a small menu, make sure you do everything perfectly."

The ambiance is nice- we liked the lighting and furniture. However, our server never checked in or asked how we were doing. We were sat in front of big vats storing multiple wine bottles so that wasn’t ideal. I wish I could say I’d return. Service is everything."

Every aspect of Warren Peace is intentional - from the interior design to the divine menu to the specialty crafted drinks, every time I’ve come here has been phenomenal.\n\nFOOD: The chef has put together a menu full of absolute masterpieces. My personal recommendation: the Cassoulet with Duck Confit AND the Duck Fat Parm-Garlic Fries. Pro-tip is to dip the fries IN the cassoulet. You will not regret it.\n\nDRINK: As mentioned, each drink is hand crafted. The head bartender clearly puts effort into the cocktails. I would highly recommend the Choco Old Fashioned (the bourbon is infused with cacao nibs), the Warren Negroni and the La Vie en Rose. But honestly, you can’t go wrong with anything behind the bar.\n\nSelfishly I want this hidden gem to stay hidden, but the world deserves to know that Warren Peace is the place to be."

I am telling you - the calamari salad, steak entree and that beautiful pistachio brûlée at the end - you won’t be wrong with that. The head bartender, Lucas, really know his mixology - all of the cocktails on the list are tasty, I especially liked their chocolate bitters Old Fashioned, Last Word (herbaceous classic) and Sticky Lips.
