We got lost (first time in NYC) and showed up 30 minutes late to our reservation and the hostesses and waitress managed to still make it an amazing experience for us . We did a 4 course meal and every dish was perfection . The atmosphere is so fun and light and watching the all the chefs and waiters work together was amazing . They put in extra effort into everything they did . I will definitely be coming back next time I’m in New York"

            "text": "I visited Manhattan twice during a recent business trip from Ireland, and both visits were absolutely outstanding.\nOn our first night, we arrived without a reservation and were asked to wait briefly before being escorted up to the bar area on the 60th floor. We were initially seated at a table back from the bar, but when seats opened up, the staff kindly offered to move us right up to the bar — a thoughtful touch that really set the tone for the evening. The views over midtown Manhattan at night were spectacular, and the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming.\nWe enjoyed it so much that we decided to return the next evening, this time with a party of eight. Once again, the staff were friendly, professional, and accommodating. After a short wait, we were brought to a beautiful corner alcove with an incredible view through a massive window — the kind of view that makes you just stop and take it all in.\nA little while later, our server came over and asked if we’d like to move to a couch area. To our surprise, he brought us into the Bay Room — normally reserved for private events — since it wasn’t booked that evening. He gave us a spacious couch area with the most breathtaking view looking west at sunset over Liberty Island. It was truly magical, and without a doubt one of the highlights of my entire week in New York.\nThe ambience at Manhattan is spot-on: background music at just the right level, great for conversation, and a fantastic selection of cocktails and drinks. But what really makes this place stand out is the people — the staff and management. They’re professional, thoughtful, and genuinely kind. It’s clear the whole operation is very well run and guest-focused.\nI can’t recommend Manhattan highly enough. It’s an elegant, well-managed venue with world-class views and even better service. I’ll definitely be returning the next time I’m in New York."

            "text": "I have had this place on my radar for years! I saw pictures of the view online. It seemed to have all of the best elements for an elevated (Literal & Figurative) restaurant. Unfortunately, it's sometimes hard to corral all of the members of the friend-group. Since I couldn't \"assemble The Avengers.\" I reserved Manhatta for a solo visit.\n\nI was called in to the Manhattan HQ of my employer on a Tuesday. As the day was ending I was poking around my map of flags, looking for a rooftop. I figured I would skip rush hour, have dinner and then drive back after the \"rat race\" had cleared up. Manhatta popped up, with reservation space so I booked it, then booked it downtown from 34th St. I'm so glad I did!\n\nI went with the four course option. Surprisingly, the waiter said that some people feel like that's too much food. I thought the portions were perfect and I went all the way through to dessert. My choices were as follows, Hamachi Crudo, Spanish Octopus, and Sea Bass. My dessert choice was their signature Toasted Rice Millefeuille with Koshikari Rice Cream and hazelnut caramel. The courses all \"hit\" on every level (Taste, presentation, color, smell etc.) In between they also provided some extra small bites as well as pallet-cleansers.\n\nWhile I marveled at the view (270° Stunning degrees)... and the food... I also had some wine (Sauvignon Blanc), but they also had this cocktail called \"The Coconut Exchange\" (If I recall correctly), and that bad boy stole the show for me! I would've ordered two but rush hour driving was looming. Cocktail lovers, try that first!\n\nMeanwhile, THE SERVICE, very very good. They were attentive but not obtrusive. Everyone seemed genuinely kind. When I say, \"everyone,\" I mean Everyone, including hosts, Maitre'Ds, waiters, waitresses etc. I'm not sure why this place doesn't have a Michelin Star. My Manhatta experience rivaled that of other Michelin-rated restaurants I've been to around NYC, maybe even the world.\n\nSpeaking of service, before I leave, I want to give a big shoutout to the curly-haired, blonde, petite waitress, Nina (?). We had a few short mini-conversations about the cocktails, the view and even her travels to South Korea. Her calm demeanor and kindness punctuated the service for me. Go ahead and promote her! If anyone asks why, tell them that one of the representatives of one of the biggest labor unions in the country said so, haha!\n\nBottom Line: Make the trip to visit, but this place is so good, you might want to reserve it for a special celebration or anniversary. (One of my friends from college said he proposed to his wife there and now it all makes sense). ;-)"

The staff went out of their way to personalize the experience with birthday wishes (which started with the friendly hostess in the lobby), a message on the table, and a birthday dessert treat! These gestures were much appreciated! The service was exceptional. Pete and Keir were our main servers, and they were wonderful - very personable, knowledgeable, attentive, and professional. The support team was equally as good. A special shout-out to Eric, who I believe made my fabulous lemon-drop martinis! The four-course menu was exquisite and included complimentary palate cleansers and delicious sour-dough bread. Every dish was flavorful and creatively presented. And, of course, the views are stunning! I highly recommend Manhatta for your next dining experience, be it a special occasion or simply an excuse to spoil yourself with fabulous food and service!"

Not only does Manhatta offer a delightful menu with exceptionally prepared dishes (the burger is undoubtedly the best in the city), but it also provides a first-class dining experience, set in a chic, yet welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe service, however, is where the restaurant comes into its own. I have been to Manhatta at least a dozen times, and the service from waiters to managers is never short of excellent. During our most recent visit, there was an unfortunate incident involving a significant spill of a special bottle we corkaged; however, without hesitation, the entire team dealt with the matter professionally, promptly, and fairly, leaving us grateful for their attentiveness and character.\n\nManhatta is a delight and well worth visiting time and time again."

No pre-meal bread was provided to us (we saw other tables had it). It was my birthday today, the dining area staff and including the waiter who took the order, were not very polite and had no service attitude.

Add to that a knowledgeable and friendly staff, and that would be enough to make for a great dining experience. But wait, there's more! The view! 60 stories up with most of Manhattan, the Hudson, the East River and beyond all in your field of view. Put it all together and you will have an amazing and memorable dining experience."

We started the evening with drinks at the bar, and the view alone was worth the visit—panoramic, breathtaking, and the perfect way to set the tone for dinner. The bar team was fantastic, and the atmosphere up there is just stunning.\n\nWe were celebrating a special occasion, and the staff made it memorable. Despite already ordering two bottles of wine, they surprised us with complimentary glasses of champagne and an extra dessert at the end—such a thoughtful and generous gesture.\n\nThe food was excellent across the board—elegant, well-executed, and full of flavor. The whole experience felt elevated yet relaxed, and the service was attentive without being overbearing.\n\nWould definitely recommend Manhatta for anyone looking to celebrate something special—or just enjoy one of the best views in the city with great food and warm hospitality."

We were seated beside the window and it was pleasant to admire the view outside while dining. The food was fine, except my mother’s fish entrée arrived undercooked and raw inside. She felt a bit sick afterwards. However, when she told Sam he immediately offered to have the dish replaced, which made up for it. She did enjoy the fish the second time around, once it was cooked properly. The great service made up for the mishap with the food. We had an enjoyable lunch overall - Sam really made the difference and turned it from an average meal to a standout experience."

From the food, to the views, to the service, there was not one thing I wish had been done differently!\n\nThe food:\nWe started with the Hamachi and Tortellini. The tortellini was cooked to perfection with a delicious sauce. It definitely stole the show and I would highly recommend ordering it.\n\nOur waiter recommended the Dry Aged Duck, which I have never had, and I was so glad I went with his recommendation. Definitely going to add it to my palette. They also provided delicious bread throughout the meal.\n\nFinally, the dessert. The best restaurant dessert I’ve ever had. Frankly, I don’t even remember the exact names, but they provided this cake like treat for my fiances birthday as well and it was incredible.\n\nThe service and view couldn’t have been any better and I definitely look forward to coming back for a meal. They also provided binoculars so you can see the city at an even more incredible view.\n\n5/5 for Manhatta."

You get to choose between 3 or 4 course tasting menu and also get a pre-appetizer and a pallet cleaner between main and desert. Everything was delicious and of course the presentation was beautiful. Magnifecent views most definitely add to the experience, especially if you are lucky to sit by the window, it is very romantic. Hope to be back one day."

It feels like you’re floating above Manhattan with iconic landmarks in every direction. I love that one side has a lively, busy vibe while the other is much more quiet and romantic, so you can choose the atmosphere you’re in the mood for.\n\nThe cocktails are excellent, the staff is consistently friendly and welcoming, and I was pleasantly surprised that there’s usually little to no wait at the bar even without a reservation. Overall, it’s a beautiful spot whether you want an energetic night out or a more intimate evening. I’ll definitely be coming back to try the food."

I am happy to report though that this skepticism was absolutely smashed by the meal we had at Manhatta. The food from start to finish was stunning, incredibly palatable and far more complex than every high-up eatery I’ve been to. Not to mention the service was truly impressive, and such a breath of fresh air having experienced sub-par service in the US for so long. Not a single element of the experience was waited on, and every server was so incredibly pleasant.

Our party of four tried almost all combinations of the four course menu. We liked a couple of dishes (scallops, duck) but we found everything else wanting. The seabass and octopus were inferior to most Mediterranean restaurants. And the steak was inferior to most steakhouses.\nOverall I am sorry to say that this restaurant is just a tourist trap.
