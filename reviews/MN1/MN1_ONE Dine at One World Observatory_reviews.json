They were a bit slow but attentive when able to grab their attention. It was worth the view. Pita was served warm and the truffle fries lived up to the expectation. Chicken was ok. Wine nice and chilled but not very large pours. Wine and apps ended up costing close to $200. Still worth it."

The staff was very kind, at first they sat me second row (to the view) but after a reservation cancelled they moved me closer to the windows so I could enjoy the view better. The Spinach Lasagna was so good, the sauce was incredible, highly recommend this if you are dining here!"

The setting is sleek and upscale, perfect for special occasions. The menu features elevated American cuisine—think seared scallops, steaks, and creative cocktails. While the food is good, the real star is the ambiance. Prices are on the higher end, reflecting the location. Reservations are recommended, especially around sunset for a stunning skyline backdrop. Ideal for a memorable New York evening."

Food was fantastic! Kids had a burger and Mac and cheese and loved them. Great end to our day visiting the observation deck to have a late lunch after visiting and before we headed to the memorial.  We were dressed in polos and tennis shoes and while I wish we had been dressier there were people of all forms of dress from fancier to business casual to like us in shorts and tennis shoes."

They did not have a table reserved for us so we were given a table in their very loud bar. Our view of Manhattan was instructed by a massive pillar. The sub par food was a disappointment compared to the many other great restaurants we enjoyed in New York. All of this is fine if you may be showing up for a quick drink after a tour. But the expensive VIP dinner is definitely not worth it. Enjoy the tower but fine dining will definitely not be spotted within the view from the top."

When visiting the freedom Tower again, we will plan to have dinner at ONE Dine so we can sample some more of their tasty treats.  Haque M was our server and he is perfection. He took our orders in a timely manner, and checked in on this frequently, but was not intrusive. Anything we needed, he made sure we had.  As we were preparing to take a selfie of our group, he hurried over and asked to take the photo for us. He took the photo from several angles, ensuring the perfect shot with the best background in the City.  This man is an outstanding server and a great ambassador for ONE Dine!

Located at the top of One World Trade Center, the views alone are worth the visit. You get a 360-degree panoramic view of the New York City skyline, which is absolutely breathtaking, especially as the sun sets over the Hudson River.\n\nThe food was just as impressive as the view. I started with the lobster bisque, which was rich and creamy with just the right amount of seasoning. For the main course, I had the dry-aged New York strip steak – it was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth with every bite. The service was impeccable, with our server being friendly, professional, and always ready with recommendations.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant itself is elegant yet comfortable, with modern decor and large windows that allow you to take in the stunning sights of the city as you dine. It’s clear that every detail, from the food to the service, has been carefully curated to create an exceptional experience.\n\nIf you’re visiting New York and want a truly memorable dining experience, I would highly recommend ONE Dine. It’s the perfect place for a special occasion or just to treat yourself to an incredible evening with an unparalleled view."

Most tables are oriented towards a view, and the restaurant is on the 101st floor (above the 100th floor observatory). We ended up spending about $160 for two. Keep in mind drinks are quite pricey and there is a mandatory gratuity of 18 percent added to each check.\n\nOne disappointment is that you need to purchase tickets to the observatory to even access the restaurant. Had the food at the restaurant be cheaper, this wouldn't be a complaint. However, given the nearly $100 price tag for two observatory tickets plus the cost of the food, I walked away spending nearly $265 for dinner. Nonetheless, this is an iconic building with a view unlike any other in New York City. It is worth the visit and price!"

Despite arriving 20 minutes early and politely requesting a window seat, we were abruptly cut off and spoken over by Tracy, who was rude, unprofessional, and clearly had an attitude. Her behavior set the tone for what became an even worse experience with our server, Andrea Lee, who barely spoke, took our order, and then vanished. The service was indifferent at best and downright disrespectful at worst. On top of that, the menu changes every few months, so don’t expect to get what you see on Yelp or OpenTable. Our options were limited and underwhelming. Save your money—do the observatory tour and eat somewhere else."

Although it’s not cheap, at around $70 per person, it’s relatively reasonable for the experience you get. It's essential to make a reservation in advance, and note that you also need to purchase elevator tickets to access the restaurant—having just a reservation won't suffice.\n\nThe view from One Dine is absolutely stunning, particularly at night. I highly recommend going for dinner rather than lunch to fully appreciate the amazing atmosphere after dark. However, while the ambiance and view are top-notch, the food itself is quite mid-quality. It's a decent dining experience, but don't expect gourmet cuisine.\n\nOverall, One Dine offers a memorable experience thanks to its breathtaking views and evening ambiance, making it worth a visit despite the average food quality. If you're planning to go, make sure to look at the pictures and reserve your spot well in advance."

The views from there are stunning.\n\nThe two drinks included in the package are limited to $23 each in value which gets you most drinks except premium wines and spirits. The food was very good. We had burratta (very good) and pork belly (too much fat) to start, followed by steak frites for a main course, which was excellent and perfectly cooked. The deserts were OK.\n\nThe ambience left a lot to be desired. There was party of about 14 there who were very noisy (one had even brought a yapping dog) and we were overlooking the Observatory deck, which added to the noise. In addition, there seemed to be some people there just having a drink or a bar snack and on two occasions people paused immediately next to our table to look at the view and take photos while standing over us. The staff were nice but the service was slow.\n\nIt wasn't a particularly relaxing dining experience and we weren't right next to a window so I think diners with the basic package were no worse off than us. We've eaten in similar restaurants (The Shard in London, CN Tower in Toronto, Sky Tower in Auckland) and all those place offered a genuine, relaxing restaurant experience with tables that gave diners a better view of the outside.\n\nMy advice would be to pay for  the basic Observatory ticket and eat elsewhere."

The food was decent, change the location and it would not have been worth the price at all. The quality of the tables the space and the loudness it doesn’t match the expectations that comes with the price…The steak was not super hot and seemed like it had been sitting in the kitchen awhile before brining it out. I found a piece of paper in my dessert. The staff in restaurants was very nice, but when we went down to the observatory deck the staff was rude and unprofessional. If you’re going to complain about your job and the guests…wait until no one is around."

The server Hack was an outstanding gentleman and should definitely be recognized for his hospitality. The only takeaway is the way the restaurant is kind of open with the observation piece with can create noise pollution from other people when dining. Also maybe if the dining area had a little bit of music that probably could’ve canceled that out."

            "text": "We celebrated our 6 year anniversary and One Dine did not disappoint. We highly recommend coming here for any special occasion.\n\nWe did the all inclusive dining experience with window seating.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n- Views were perfect at sunset and a great transition to night lights\n\n- Food was absolutely delicious from start to end and they give generous portions. You will most likely take food home!\n\n- Staff were truly sweet and so accommodating. Special shout out to Frank who took care of us the whole night and to Josephine who gave us an amazing and special experience in the observatory\n\nTHINGS TO KNOW:\n- Dress attire - most people are casual so the “upscale” feel isn’t there initially but as time passes you kinda forget that.\n\n- Noise level - if you want a more intimate dinner experience, I recommend you schedule your time for later in the evening to limit the noise from the observatory guests.\n\n- Window seat table - it’s nice but I wouldn’t say it’s all that great because you are still kinda far from the glass and since the observatory ticket lets you get closer I don’t think the window seat is all that special. It would be better if the seating was right up against the actual glass.\n\n- Decor lacks a luxury or slightly elevated feel. It’s not all that impressive when you arrive. I honestly thought it was part of the cafe. I recommend you sit towards the back of the dining area."

I enjoyed the Uptown Martini more than my partner’s New World Fashion.\n\nWe sat by the bar as we came here after work and didn’t think to make a reservation for a table by the windows. Nonetheless, we were able to capture the beautiful sunset views from the bar.\n\nService was average, and we had to remind the bartender for some water - this is NYC, you get a glass of New York's finest as soon as you are seated."

While the drink menu has a decent selection, I’d recommend customizing your own, or ask for a drink you are used to (your go to), as the options provided didn't quite hit the mark for me.\n\nThe hostess was warm and welcoming, setting a great first impression. However, once seated, the service felt somewhat disconnected, as different staff members handled seating and table service.\n\nFor an all-inclusive experience, I expected something truly special for my family, but unfortunately, it fell short. We were hoping for a memorable evening, one that made us feel appreciated and wowed, but even my children walked away disappointed. It is not kids friendly and would recommend a local restaurant, a place that sells pizza or other foods to quench the need for a descent food. Zaza is one of the great restaurants that comes to mind. Having had the pleasure of eating exemplary dishes in Europe, and the observatory depicting the countries that have visited it, their menu fails to bring in great dishes or tastes, minus a few sides.\nTake advantage of browsing the menu to see if you want to pay for such meals prior to committing.\nThe pictures proudly posted online as you search for restaurants to dine in may have been as such a while back, but not the as current as their presented menu.\nExpect the automatic/default 18% gratuity to your check, no matter the size or order."

The breathtaking panoramic views of the city's skyline coupled with impeccable service made for an unforgettable experience. However, it was the exceptional drinks that truly stole the show. The Old Fashioned cocktail, expertly crafted with precision and a perfect balance of flavors, was a sheer delight. Sipping on this timeless classic while taking in the mesmerizing views was a true highlight of the evening. As for the food, the oysters were incredibly fresh and served with a variety of delectable accompaniments that enhanced their natural brininess. The shrimp pasta, with its perfectly al dente noodles and succulent shrimp, was a symphony of flavors that transported me to coastal culinary paradise. This observatory restaurant proves that it's not just the breathtaking vistas, but also the exceptional drinks and superb food, that make it an absolute must-visit destination for both locals and tourists alike."
