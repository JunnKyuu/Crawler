From the second we sat down, he had the best vibe — super friendly, funny, and somehow managed to keep up with a packed bar without missing a beat. Our drinks came out fast and the food was delicious!\n\nHe kept checking in just enough to make sure we were good, but never hovered — honestly, it felt like we had a friend working behind the scenes making sure our night went smoothly. You can tell he genuinely enjoys what he does because his energy is contagious.\n\nBy the end of the night, everyone at our table was talking about how great he was. If you go to this bar, do yourself a favor and ask for Benny. You’ll get great service, great laughs, and he will definitely become your favorite server! I will be coming back!"

Even when busy, he remembers you, your order and tries to make your experience special. I’ve spent hours here and have watched him rip and run during his shift while still finding time to stop & give his undivided attention to every annoying “where’s the restroom” and “do you have repasado?”. He is a huge plus to this place and I will continue coming back as long as he’s here! Ask for Benny!\n\nAlso, it’s loud as hell. Ofc that’s expected, but thought I’d make that clear."

No follow up by the waitress to see if we needed anything, and then had to track her down to ask for the check.  Then came the biggest shock... $6.50 for a soda.  Wasn't even offered a refill.

Erica was our server, she was very helpful and kind. The manager was also super accommodating when a few of our party was late.

            "text": "Overall it’s a typical sports bar. Loud music over voices and a million screens for sports. My expectations were low for food given that its a sports bar but if you want food with your drink and friends to fill you up while you watch a game, don’t come here.\n\nI ordered wings and not only were half of my wings raw inside (check photos) but they charged a $1 extra for a small cup of ranch and $2 extra for a small plate of celery. I assume they cook the flats and sticks together but the drumsticks are so thick that the meat doesn’t cook all the way through.\n\nAll in all it was $20 bucks for 8 pieces of half cooked chicken, some sauce and some watery and warm celery sticks. Find somewhere else to eat if you can."
