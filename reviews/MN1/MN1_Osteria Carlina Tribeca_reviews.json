The playlist was great and towards the night it picked up. I had the oysters as the appetizer followed by  the red snapper filet . Amazing! Perfectly flavored and complemented by the spinach and mushrooms. I can’t wait come back again.the manager Raul was great and made sure I was having a great experience .

The wines Valeria recommended, Barolo and Brunello di Montalcino, were perfect pairings.\n\n🍰🍸☕️ We finished with the giandujotto and a fun twist on dessert—make-your-own espresso martini.\n\nManager Raul was also very attentive. You can feel the passion and teamwork from start to finish.

I had a magical birthday dinner at Osteria Carlina Tribeca, thanks to a surprise date from my boyfriend — and everything from the food to the service was outstanding.\n\nWe were warmly welcomed and seated by the manager, TJ, who was a knowledgeable and gracious host. Our server, Vincent, was incredibly kind and attentive throughout the night, with additional support from Felipe who made sure we were well taken care of.\n\nWe started with a bottle of bubbles and warm, melt-in-your-mouth focaccia fatta in casa with whipped butter. For appetizers, we had the Polpettine Langarole — perfectly prepared — along with the Insalata Carlina, a bed of delicious greens, and their special risotto balls, which my boyfriend couldn’t stop talking about!\n\nOur mains were the Tajarin alla Bolognese, beautifully balanced in flavor and salt, and the Involtini di Pollo, served with a rich wine reduction that I’m still craving. We ended the night with a classic tiramisu, paired with an espresso martini and a Sergio Leone cocktail — both expertly crafted by Kenny, the amazing bartender.\n\nEvery dish was thoughtfully executed (thank you, Chef Ivan!), and the entire team made my birthday feel so special. Grazie mille to the Osteria Carlina Tribeca crew — I can’t wait to come back and explore more of the menu!"

Of course the food is amazing but the real star of the show was the service; particularly our server Nelson. Food highlights were the in season whiter truffles and their dessert. Nelson provided exquisite service during the entire meal.\n\nWe were promptly seated for our reservation and the staff was so on point. We were ushered to a very cozy table for two at arguably the best table in the restaurant. We ordered our cocktails and really fawned over the menu before making our selections. We started with the risotto with white truffles and the presentation of the risotto and of Nelson slicing the truffles table side was a super nice touch. We shared a hanger steak with two glasses of wine that Nelson recommended and the flavors of the shallot reduction were enhanced by the Nebbiolo that Nelson recommended. After two shots of Limoncello were downed, we moved to the Giandujotto for dessert with espressos. The dessert was heavenly. We will definitely return and will always ask for Nelson. Thank you for such a wonderful Christmas dinner!"

Oh and the wine is even worse. The wine list is outrageous. We opted for a Super Tuscan at $160 and it was horrible. We left the majority of the bottle and could t get out of there fast enough. We actually enjoyed the Stracciatella with spring peas and herbs, served with homemade focaccia. It would’ve been nice if they offered more that two tiny pieces of focaccia for all that cheese. The lasagna and fried chicken were horrible, and they were the two dishes our server was adamant on us ordering. Never again."

The food was very good and the atmosphere was great for a Friday night dinner on the terrace. A great place for a dinner with your significant other or an aperitif with a friend visiting the city. A quality experience!"

Clean and keeping true to Turin toots. (Been there and awesome.) Moreno has lead this wonderful new place in Tribeca following the success of West Village and Brooklyn.  Marvelous and true to Turin."

Highly recommend the Barolo by the glass. We got lucky on Super Bowl night and had live music next to the bar, some quiet jazz to round off the evening was nice."

Service was outstanding to say the least! Everyone on their team was warm and seemed to genuinely care about making sure we were taken care of and having a great time. Thank you to Moreno, William, Anna and the entire waitstaff for being so attentive, courteous and thoughtful! We need more restaurants like this in NYC."
