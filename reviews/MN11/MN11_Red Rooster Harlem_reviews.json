But the chicken and waffles I and my friend ordered,  tasted old. Not good at all. The cost of what I spent on this meal was NOT worth the price of admission. I will not be back."

            "text": "My wife visited NYC and decided to try some of the restaurants that are associated with celebrity chefs on Food Network. We were very excited to find Red Rooster Harlem is associated with Marcus Samuelsson and had to try it out.\n\nUpon entering we were greeted with a live jazz/blues band, and my son absolutely loved watching and listening to them! The colors and decor made me feel the Harlem of old. We were seated quickly and our server was very attentive to our needs, especially with a 1 year old and 3 year old, providing us with a high chair. The table was wobbly and chairs felt loose, and if I were 100 lbs heavier man I think it could have broken the chair.\n\nThe food unfortunately was mixed. We tried corn bread, ox tail with rice, shrimp and grits, and fried chicken breast and thigh. The good: ox tail was very rich and tasty, and the grits were creamy and buttery. The okay: the cornbread was a bit hard and really nothing special on its own, but the butter that came with it helped elevate the taste. The bad: the shrimp was overcooked and semi-rubbery, and the fried chicken was dry and over fried. The batter wasn’t amazing either, a lot fast food fried places do it better. Even after getting a replacement it still wasn’t that great.\n\nAll in all the experience was mixed, and made me wonder if my expectations were too high. Food prices are fairly high, so perhaps I am justified in expecting higher quality and more sophistication in flavor."

The vibe they have now is really nice. Great drinks, amazing food that is consistent. Really nice live music and a great ambiance - what's not to love?\n\nMy local harlem friends might argue that it's a little too touristy but IMO it's a great mix of Harlemites and visitors.

I would go back to NY just to go to Red Rooster. I don’t know that I’ve enjoyed a restaurant like I did RR in years. Who ever the manager or the owner is, they are on to something. I consider myself a classy lady. This checked and exceeded all of my boxes. I was pleasantly surprised… I’m going back. Very Soon! Consider coming to DC. I would support you"

Our water was never empty, the food was served quickly, and while we were never ignored, our server didn’t hover. The table next to us dropped a fork on the floor and a manager was there within seconds to take the dirty from the patron and provide a clean one.\n\nThere was entertainment there that night. It wasn’t A-list, but their set list was great. Only complaint, they were out of three of the beers on the menu, which happened to be our first three choices.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience, and a nice night out."

I had a 4 of the happy hour drinks. My favorite was the pink round drink I forgot the name of. The drinks were definitely doing their job. You have to sit at the bar to be able to have a drink at happy hour price, which I wish it would’ve been applied to regular tables. The vibe here gives the tv show “Girlfriends”. The decor here is beautiful and the live music was very refreshing. All women band, and they were great, and I was very entertained. It started to get packed around 6pm and it was a Thursday night! I’ve walked past this place so many times and finally came in. Definitely didn’t regret it, and will be coming again."

            "text": "For our trip to see Gypsy, I started thinking about what else we could do while in the city. With only 24 hours, options were limited. We had already locked in Melba’s for Saturday lunch, but Sunday before hitting the road? That was easy - Red Rooster. I’ve been a fan of Marcus Samuelsson for a while and had wanted to visit his restaurant, but since we rarely get to New York, it just never happened. This trip, though, it was on.\n\nStill recovering from the energy of Gypsy and Times Square, we managed to get up and ready for our 11 a.m. brunch reservation. The drive didn’t take long at all - so quick, in fact, that we arrived about 40 minutes early. Parking was also a breeze (thank you, Sunday street rules).\n\nFrom the outside, you’re welcomed by the glowing Red Rooster sign, Moulin Rouge style, with a cozy covered patio. Inside, we were greeted by a young man whose personality was as bright as the sign outside. The space itself was gorgeous, though I didn’t get to take it all in right away - we opted to sit outside since it was such a nice day.\n\nFrom my seat, I caught glimpses of the interior: chandeliers trimmed with rooster feathers, eclectic décor with a punch of sophistication - very much Marcus Samuelsson’s vibe.\n\nFor food, I ordered the red velvet pancake with walnuts, bacon, and scrambled eggs, plus a side of creamy stone-ground grits. My mom went classic with the chicken and waffles. When the plates arrived, our first thought was, “We need a bigger table.” But we made it work, and honestly, I was full before I even took a bite - the plating was that good.\n\nThe only hiccup was my eggs being a little too salty, but that was quickly fixed with no fuss. My second plate was perfect. My mom, meanwhile, didn’t say a word - she just enjoyed her crispy chicken and soaked in the atmosphere.\n\nOnce again, way too much food, and once again, no complaints. Takeaway trays saved the day.\n\nBefore we hit the road, I slipped inside to visit the restroom and finally got a full look at the space. Absolutely stunning. Every corner of the design felt intentional, stylish, and alive. My favorite spot was the parlor - it had this vibe of community and creativity. You could imagine people sipping cocktails, maybe smoking cigars, closing deals, or just enjoying each other’s company.\n\nI loved everything about Red Rooster and I’m so glad we finally made it happen."

Most people seemed to be holding out for later tables, and by the time we were leaving, we saw why. Live jazz kicked in at noon, and the vibe instantly came alive. Unfortunately, most of the food we ordered felt a bit overpriced.\n\nCornbread – This is the one I’d come back for. They cut it right before serving, so it stayed fluffy and moist, with a roasted tomato–corn butter that added just the right sweet-savory tang. At $9 for two pieces, it’s steep but worth it.\n\nFried Chicken – Priced by the piece ($8 thigh, $9 breast), so obviously we expected perfection. The skin was shatteringly crisp and dusted with their signature “chicken shake” seasoning (garlic, cinnamon, etc), but the meat was a tad overcooked. My favorite part of the dish was the sauce, which tasted like a spicy tomato-based béchamel sauce that was so addictive.\n\nShrimp & Grits – Classic setup with okra and a savory chorizo broth. The okra’s stickiness actually worked really well. It bonded everything in its rich, dense mucilage. Still, the price was a bit ambitious.\n\nMac & Greens – Two solid components, better apart than together. The sharp cheddar-parm base plus savory greens ended up blurring into a heavy, one-note bite."

Our entrees were equally delicious. I loved the Mac and greens, though I would have liked a bit more greens. The steak frites was the best dish, personally. The meat was tender and juicy and it was done right! The fries were crispy and not overdone. Desserts were phenomenal— I had the red velvet, which was rich creamy and decadent.  We had such a great dining experience, Marcus ought to be proud!! We will return."

Our waitress Sylvia, also greeted us with a beautiful smile & we felt welcomed. The atmosphere was inviting & relaxing. We eat lunch while listening to live Reggae music from Brooklyn Night band. We felt we were transport to Jamaica. We would definitely go back to the Red Rooster again."

The atmosphere is vibrant, the music adds great energy, and the service is warm and welcoming. Every dish was a hit—especially the fried chicken and cornbread. A must-visit spot for amazing food and live music!"

We thought that we might have to order at the bar because no one came by for 20 mins after we were seated. We got the chicken and waffles… the waffles were great but the chicken was burned underneath.\nSad that the quality hasn’t held up from years prior. Great drinks and the staff was friendly when we had interactions with them… but probably won’t be coming back, especially with how expensive it is for the quality. I’d say if you come here definitely sit at the bar and enjoy the jazz— the atmosphere is amazing!"

I wasn’t addressed by the server yet the table next to me who came in 5+ minutes after me (different race) was immediately greeted by the server.\n\nThe hostess comes to my table and explained that the server saw my bottle of water so she “assumed” I was already being helped.\n\nHow so? I still had the menu in front of me.\nThe hostess (who was nice) proceeds to tell me that I need to put my water bottle up. I’m not putting my water bottle on the floor and unbeknownst to them. I usually order a couple drinks to try when I’m enjoying lunch/dinner.\n\nI took this as the last sign that my business was not needed or wanted. I left and found a delicious Jamaican spot a couple blocks down that was 1/3 of the price and I’m sure just as delicious.\n\nI doubt if I was the same color as the “other table”, this would have been an issue."

I sat out on the cute patio, which was a very nice space. I had some of the best Deviled eggs ever, I've tried plenty in different cities, and these are top tier. I also ordered  a hibiscus drink & the meal meatballs with mash thst I am still thinking about days after. Everything was prepared perfectly. Red Rooster will be obe of my go-to spots wherever I am in NYC."

The fried chicken was, without question, the best I have ever tasted. Its perfectly crispy skin and exceptionally juicy meat, complemented by the house special hot sauce, deliver an authentic southern experience. The shrimp and grits, though elegantly prepared, fell slightly short of the bold, rustic southern flavors I had hoped for. The deviled eggs and apple pie, however, were spot on—so delicious that they left me eager for another visit. Overall, it was a fantastic dining experience, and I highly recommend it."

You feel like you're in the historic Harlem and the food is like you're in the heart of the South.\n\nThis was my first visit for Sunday brunch. Reservations are highly recommended as it gets crowded quickly.  The live band added to the overall atmosphere. The food, however, makes it worth the stop, with or without music.\nHighly recommended the cornbread. Good warning: it's closer to pound cake than to what we think of as cornbread- and that is a good thing. It comes with 2 slices .\nThe Mac n greens combo of macaroni and cheese and collars greens is DELICIOUS. I'm going to try and make this at home.\nThe fried chicken is super tasty and the pieces are big .\n\nYou will not leave hungry. In fact, it's more likely that you will not be able to finish your food. You should leave with a full stomach and big smile.\n\nThis is a must visit when in NYC, even if you weren't planning on going to Harlem."

Our table was well attended to with great recommendations for menu choices and our glasses topped with water.\nWe chose the Chicken Tower that came with three sauces (honey, hot, ketchup), the Pan Fried Catfish, Mac and Greens, Roasted Asparagus and the Creamy Grits.\nThe chicken was the best fried chicken I've had and would recommend at least trying a drumstick and thigh for how tender and moist they were. The initial crunch of the skin and flavour that followed was fantastic.\nEverything was delicious, if we had to recommend a side it would be the  Catfish.\nThe bathroom amenities are also kept very clean."

            "text": "Disappointing Experience – Overrated & Overpriced\n\nI dined at Red Rooster Restaurant on August 23rd with my two kids, and unfortunately, the experience left much to be desired. From the moment we arrived, things were off — there was no hostess at the door, and despite the restaurant not being full, we waited a while to be seated. Once seated, instead of promptly taking our order, our waitress seemed more focused on setting tables than tending to us. I ordered the catfish with black-eyed peas, but what arrived was underwhelming — a large portion of black-eyed peas with a catfish fillet just placed on top. It looked more like something thrown together at home than a $26 restaurant dish. Visually unappetizing, and definitely not worth the price. Sadly, this experience reminded me of why I stopped coming here in the first place. I had hoped things had improved, but it seems not much has changed. Red Rooster, please do better — your reputation deserves better than what we experienced tonight."
