However, a happy hour food is only worth it if you’re getting a deal. The wings are regular price there’s just fewer of them- For for $10 when a full order is six for 15.  A real deal would be to have AT LEAST 5 Five wings for $10.  I still enjoy it here, but maybe give people a deal. It’s hard out here today."

Loved the energy of the whole place. Highly recommend reviewers to stop by. We went in around 5pm on a Sat and left around 730pm. There was a nice crowd even then. We heard it got livelier around 10 but we had to head to BK that night...if not we would have hung around longer or came back for sure. I most definitely will be returning to the Corner Social on my next visit back to NYC. *UPDATE 2025* Just FYI still love Harlem still love Corner Social. Years later they still got it!!! Always cool vibes when I visit. Period."

The 2nd time during this visit, the grits were so lumpy and hard like they were sitting or rushed. I would still return because it's a great vibe, and I love the food options.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere that instantly made me feel at home. The establishment was impeccably clean, which added to the overall pleasant ambiance.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was the fantastic music playing throughout the venue. It set the tone for a fun and lively evening, making it impossible not to enjoy myself. The DJ played everything, and I mean everything, from R&B to merengue to dembow and others!\n\nI was particularly impressed by the selection of drinks available. Whether you're in the mood for a classic cocktail or something more adventurous, Corner Social has something for everyone.\n\nA bonus was the welcoming demeanor of the security staff at the entrance. He ensured everyone felt safe and comfortable while maintaining a friendly atmosphere.\n\nCorner Social is a gem of a place that perfectly balances a fun vibe, excellent service, and a great environment. I can't wait to return!"

However, I was really disappointed with the food and beverage 3/10. The food lacked seasoning,  it was very bland to the point that the only thing I ate was the french fries I ordered a mango Margarita that was utterly disgusting. It seems like they just poured drink in a glass with ice and added a dash of tequila. That was very upsetting to me because I was looking forward to something tasty to wake up my taste buds. I most likely will not return."

I’m rating two stars because the very unfriendly and nasty behavior towards us from the hostess. She made a whole ordeal and caused a scene all because we asked to be sat away from the door, which we had no issue waiting for another table to become available if the larger tables were for lager parties. As someone who’s managed restaurant for three years and who frequents this restaurant whenever in this side of town, her behavior was distasteful and not at the level of someone who should be working as the main point of contact for customers. I hope the next time I visit if she’s there her behavior would have been corrected to meet the standard of hospitality."

There was already quite a few people there, but we were seated immediately without a reservation. You can order from the brunch menu or appetizers from the regular menu. They have a nice selection. We ordered the burrito and chicken & waffles. The burrito was pretty good, could have been seasoned a bit more. The chicken & waffles were good. The chicken was well seasoned and the waffles were soft. The mimosas were $25 for a bottle (they mix it in advance) or $9 for individual mimosas. They were pretty strong! Definitely got the job done. Everything came out quickly and the service was good. The dj played a mix of r&b music and was interactive with the guests. He even does a free drink on the hour. I’d definitely return."

Saw him once when we got our waters 15mins after being seated, then to bring the food menu (no drink menu provided), then to take orders, then to bring the food, then to bring a wrong check with 20% gratuity added. That's it. No water refills, no asking if everything is OK, no asking about drinks, and then a check with extra appetizers and a 20% tip! The waiter at a nearby table was far more helpful and it would be a 5 star review if he was responsible for us. He was the one who brought the right check to us (still with 20% tip) because our waiter did not come back until I put my card on the check.\nWould definitely go back and sit in a different section, I'm sure I can update this review then to a higher rating."

They had an interactive “name that song” game with a free drink as a prize.\nGreat ambiance. The staff was incredibly attentive. Our server was Genesis. Another employee, Jeritza, was walking around with her beautiful head of curls, checking in on every party. Just making sure that everything was okay. This touch set Corner Social apart in my mind.\nOn to the food-\nI ordered the Chicken Bacon Waffle - the chicken was juicy, well seasoned and the bacon was crispy. The waffle could use some work. It was very soft but still tasted good.\nMy friend ordered the steak and eggs. She ate it but noted that the steak was chewy, the eggs had too much moisture and the bread was the best part of the dish due to the butter.\nThe mimosa bottle was large enough for multiple servings for 2 people and tasted great.\nI highly recommend corner social. It is a good spot to socialize, have some nice drinks and good food."

It can get crowded and cluttered but on the weekdays it's good.\n\nDivine the hosted was awesome and friendly made sure we got seated right away and even let us choose our table that was available near the window instead of sitting us in the center where we was originally suppose to sit - that was a super plus. A++\n\nOur server was friendly and down to earth as well. Our food was great. The lamb chops were very good enjoyed them, chicken avocado sandwich was great not dry at all, chicken quesadillas had flavor as well. Overall was great I was satisfied.\n\nFor the first time going I was truly impressed honestly. Had a great time."
