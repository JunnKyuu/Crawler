Despite the fact it’s famously impossible to get a table unless your great-grandfather once fixed jukeboxes with Frank Sinatra, the owners instantly relocated a table of six retired wiseguys in smoked sunglasses to make room for me. Had the veal, the meatballs, a little wine. Service was celestial, owners charming. Honestly, shocking they don’t just hand out keys to strangers at the door."

I found some of your frozen meals, pizza and sauces at Walmart here in Arab Alabama 👍 I've never heard of you until I looked you up to see if you have restaurants, and of course your product sold at Walmart that prompted me to look you up. Your pizza sauce is totally amazing! I must have at least 50 jars. I bought all of them in the store the other day 😁 The sauce is so delicious that it prompted me to try out your frozen meals. Your four cheese ravioli your lasagna and your chicken parmesan is outstanding!!! I haven't tried your pizza yet, but I'm about to try the cheese one next time I go to the store and I'm just going to add some extra toppings to it. If your food taste this good just from the grocery store, I can imagine how amazingly delicious it will taste in your restaurants!!❤️🕊️ I wish I could try your restaurant, but unfortunately there's none of your restaurants around my area. I will be moving back to California soon Woodland California which is around the Sacramento area. It would be nice if you can get a restaurant there! If you did I would bring my sleeping bag and camp outside Lol 🤣 Oh my gosh I just can't believe how good your food is. I'm telling everybody about it!! Walmart can't keep up with me. I keep buying all your pizza sauce! Walmart also sells your pasta sauce as well. I haven't tried those. I bought the caramelized onion one and the marinara one and I haven't tried those yet, but I'm sure they're going to be totally delicious. Thank you so much for your delicious food. There's not much restaurants here in this little town that I live in so I really appreciate your food!! 🍕 🍝 🫙 Happy Father's Day to all the dad's out there and y'all have a blessed rest of the weekend and the next following week 🙏😇🙏 I give you 10 Stars for your wonderful food!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆❤️🕊️🌹🌹🌹 I almost forgot your tomato basil soup sold in jars and your Italian wedding soup both very delicious 😋 You have Many! Dishes in the frozen section of the grocery store. So many that I can't keep up with adding them to this review 😋 I had to go to Guntersville Alabama to the Publix market there where they sell even More! Dishes. I bought your meatballs in sauce. Haven't tried them yet, but I already know they are Delish!!😋😋 I also bought your variety meat pizza, your vegetarian lasagna and other pasta dishes with white sauce😋 I would love to try and buy on a regular basis your eggplant Parmesan but none of the stores have it. I heard that Target sells it. I may have to go there as well. I'm going to have to buy a second freezer to fit all your delishes dishes because my freezer is packed with Rao's s only! Store bought frozen meals I will ever buy. 😋😋😋 Thank you for making it possible for the world to have the chance to have your food in Thier freezers and cupboards. I also bought four more of your soups. Different ones as well ❤️‍🩹😋😋😋🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ God Bless you and your family 🙏😇🙏"

While the incredible dishes look as if they have been pulled from a five-star Michelin restaurant. The authenticity of the food takes you back to Nana's kitchen in the old country and if that doesn't make you feel nostalgic enough just wait until Tommy  comes to your table to plan your meal like it was the president's daughter's wedding while making you feel like family. Even if just for the night you'll have that reminiscent  feeling of being in back in the neighborhood when there still was neighborhoods, thanks guys You're the best"

I will just  tell you what my party had for dinner last week. Apps: baked clams, roasted peppers, and the house salad. Next up: shells with ricotta and their famous meatballs all delicious. Now on to the main course: eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken parm, and shrimp fra diavolo. Dessert was delicious homemade cheesecake with chocolate ice cream and espresso. Rao's is always great.

Countless legends have eaten here over the years and if you have a chance to eat here I would jump at the opportunity because one like this does not come along very often. Being a part of the East Harlem Giglio Society, my friends and I have been here numerous times to drink at the bar which you can do but you cannot eat if you do not have a table. Getting a table is near to impossible and the only way to get one is if you  know someone.\n\nI had the privilege of eating here the Friday before Christmas December 22nd 2017 and again this past Friday March 2nd 2018. Each time was great, food was fabulous and the environment is incredible. Being that our crew knows most of the workers here makes it even better as it feels like you are going to eat with family not at a restaurant. I must say it is not the same without Frankie Pellegrino (the original owner who passed away last year) but the love is still there as well as Nicky the Vest. There are no menus, so when you place your order they tell you what are the options for the night. We sampled almost everything and all dishes were delicious.\n\nThere are no checks either, whoever pays the bill gets whisked away to the back to settle up at the end of the night. You can expect to spend a good $150-$200 per person which is pretty reasonable for the hardest place to eat in NYC. We usually stay until close and by that time you will run into see someone that is considered important. It all depends on your definition of important or famous."
