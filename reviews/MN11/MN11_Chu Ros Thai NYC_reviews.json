It was a crisp, sunny day, so we loved that the restaurant had an open-space concept; perfect for enjoying the weather. The food and drinks were absolutely amazing; everything exceeded our expectations, and I’d definitely come back again!\n\nWe had the chicken satay (so flavorful!), pineapple fried rice with chicken, and some crispy French fries all so good. The drinks were also fantastic; we tried a few and loved every single one.\nThere are two more things not added to the description but i did take pictures of them/ ones beef and ones chicken all of the sauces provided were devine."

At first I wasn’t too sure about it but the bitterness from the coffee mixed with the sweetness and then the nice smell of cinnamon made it nice.\n\nThen the appetizer came out. I ordered the five star Thai dumplings . Steamed ground chicken and shrimp dumpling. Served with soy vinaigrette sauce. The dumplings were soft but had texture and had weight too it. The soy vinaigrette was sweet and thick which I liked.\n\nLastly , I got the basil sauce . With chicken, mixed veggies ( onions, sweet red pepper, green pepper, orange pepper and some basil) with a side of jasmine rice. Eventhough I asked for it to be made spicy, It wasn’t too spicy."

We decided to try it, and it turned out to be such a wonderful experience.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious and authentic, the service was warm and attentive, and the background music was gentle and calming—just what we needed to ease our anxious hearts. By the end of our meal, we received a call from the surgeon telling us that our mom’s surgery was a great success.\n\nThis dinner brought comfort and joy to us on such a stressful day. I would love to come back again when I get the chance.\n\nHighly recommended—authentic, tasty Thai food and excellent service!"

Honestly, the variety of duck options here is like I have never seen before and we have two duck aficionados in the family.\n\nThere were also green curry, obligatory papaya salad and tom yum. With all that, the most memorable selection among us carnivores was a vegetarian entree called Eggplant’s Garden — the texture and mildly spicy sweet sauce are not to be missed.\n\nOur carefully boxed leftovers lasted two more lunches."

Every time I visit New York, I make sure to stop by. This time, I tried the Hot Pot Tom Yum Talay, and it was absolutely delicious—packed with bold, flavorful broth and fresh seafood. My brother swears by their Drunken Noodles, and I can see why!\n\nThe service was excellent, and the drinks were great too. The only thing to note is that it’s a bit pricey, our meal for two came to over $133 with tip for just 2 entres an appetizer and 2 drinks, so it’s something to consider if you're on a budget. That said, with rising prices everywhere, it’s understandable, and the quality makes it worth it.\n\nOverall, I’d give this place 4.5 stars fantastic food, great service, and a solid choice for Thai cuisine in NYC. Highly recommend!"

This place doesn’t just deliver great food; it creates an experience that feels like coming home, no matter who you are or where you're from.\n\nThe service here is nothing short of outstanding. From the moment you walk in, you’re treated with genuine warmth and hospitality. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you feel welcome and well taken care of. It's clear that they take pride in not just the food they serve, but also in creating a space where everyone feels like they belong.\n\nThe atmosphere is incredible, with a vibe that’s both cozy and vibrant. It feels like you’ve stepped out of your house only to find yourself in a place that’s just as comfortable and inviting. The decor is charming, and the ambiance strikes a perfect balance between casual and elegant.\n\nAnd then there’s the food—absolutely amazing. Chu Ros Thai doesn’t just serve Thai cuisine; they elevate it to a level that’s hard to match. Every dish is bursting with flavor, prepared with care, and presented beautifully. Whether you’re a fan of spicy curries, fresh salads, or perfectly cooked noodles, you’ll find something here that will keep you coming back for more.\n\nWhat really sets Chu Ros Thai apart, though, is the way they embrace everyone who walks through their doors. This is a place where all lifestyles are accepted, where there’s no discrimination, and where everyone is treated like family. It’s a rare and wonderful thing to find a restaurant that not only feeds your body but also nourishes your soul.\n\nChu Ros Thai is in a league of its own, and I can’t recommend it highly enough. If you’re in the area, do yourself a favor and experience it for yourself. You’ll feel like you’ve found a second home."

The Tom Yum soup was bursting with fresh, tangy flavors, and the perfect balance of spice really brought out its authentic taste. The beef fried rice was equally delicious—tender, savory, and beautifully seasoned. I also appreciated the generous portions and the attentive, friendly service from the staff. If you’re looking for top-notch Thai cuisine in a relaxed setting, this place is an absolute must-visit!"

Appreciated the decor inside that gave it a pop vibe to the place. we tried the shrimp mango salad and pork chop. The pork chop was excellent with four to five slices of charred pork with steamed veggies and rice.  The salad was also tasty with ample shrimp but I should’ve ordered with the sweet chilli dressing on the side, as it was a little too saucy for me. Will come back to try their other dishes!"

Absolutely delicious Thai cuisine that delivered on every expectation I didn't know was even hoping for.\n\nThe Thai tea was fresh made and heavy on the sweeten condensed milk. The Appetizer plate was hot, fresh, and the perfect mix of starters covering that American-Asian familiarity. By far the best part of the meal was the Pad Kea Mao. Perfectly cooked with the right amount of crisp in the protein and veggies while still maintaining the springy bounce of the noodles. The dish as a whole was generous with the sauce so every bite was perfectly dressed. Despite my impressions of how much sauce was used, there was none to be found at the bottom of my plate. Perfect.\n\nWould highly recommend this spot to anyone in the area looking for some high-quality food in a vibrant, modern setting."

            "text": "Pretty good Thai food, definitely more on the no frills side for Manhattan Thai places. Is it as authentic as you can get? No it’s not, but it’s still good for a more local neighborhood Thai place. I like that offer a variety of protein (vegetarian and vegan friendly). I don’t have any dietary restrictions myself but I appreciate their range. I got the mock duck basil over rice lunch special, portion was fair and it even came with gyozas as a small app. The basil sauce was too sweet in my opinion. I would definitely come back if I’m in the area but I wouldn’t travel out of my way to eat here."
