The lady at the register totally understood the short time we had. Liz Marie, I hope I'm spelling your name right. She is AWESOME!!! Not only did she leave the register to bring our food to the table, she came back with our water, cornbread and extra gravy for those mashed potatoes. Got our delicious food, and excellent service from Lizmarie before our waiter even came to our table. Give that lady a raise! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"

They used to have amazing fried chicken and sides, but the quality has gone downhill traumatically.  Our chicken was served to us cold on the inside, oh, it was cooked – but obviously put somewhere on the side and in a vain attempt to reheat it was made.  The only diet beverage you're gonna find there is Diet Pepsi and water, they always seem to be out of unsweetened iced tea – which is really bad if you're diabetic on a keto diet and sought out fried chicken as a meal.    Although our waitress apologized for the cold chicken, This was the third bad experience in a row at Amy Ruth’s.  We're sorry to say we have now written it off and is unredeemable.  The dining room is a loud echo chamber of flickering lights."

The guy that brought out complimentary corn bread & water was nice.  Our waitress Charmaine was great, good energy,  nice & friendly. Let me tell y'all about this food... this food made up for any negative vibe I had at 1st.  Complimentary cornbread was so good.  I had fried shrimp, string beans & mashed potatoes w gravy.  This was so delicious, my family members had barbecue ribs,  shrimp & grits,  meatloaf.  The portion size is enough for 2 people. We ordered desserts to go,  sweet potato pie, peach cobbler, pineapple coconut cake & double chocolate cake, these were huge portions also. Everyone really enjoyed their food so much we're thinking about coming back to NY from MD at least once per year just to patronize this establishment. That's how good the food was."

            "text": "I have been eating at Amy Ruth's for over 20 years. It is a classic part of my routine New York City experience. Every time I am in the city, I stop here for some classic soul food. ALWAYS!\n\nFood:\nI am a creature of habit, so I always get the President Obama special - fried chicken with macaroni and cheese, and collard greens. Sometimes, I'll add potato salad and usually treat myself to banana pudding. The banana pudding is deadly, no sinful.\n\nLocation:\nIt is in the heart of Harlem (uptown) on 116th and Malcolm X Blvd. Short walk from the 2/3 (green line Express) trains. If you're driving, there's usually plenty of parking on Malcolm X Blvd.\n\nDining Options:\nOver the years, the inside dining has changed. Where takeout is now located used to have dine-in tables, but that all changed years ago. They also used to have upstairs dining, although I don't think that's no longer an option. If you get seated on the left side of the restaurant and there's small children there, BEWARE!! There is an echo on that part of the restaurant, so fussy children yelling and/or screaming can easily become unbearable if you're trying to enjoy your meal with some sort of peace. Its like they have a microphone.\n\nRestaurant:\nThe restaurant is one big artistic mural full of many popular and renowned black artists, mostly performers, but some politicians.\n\nMenu:\nThe menu is broken down in homage to some of the black community's greats. For example: Barack Obama's name is how they identify the fried chicken dinner.\n\nAmenities:\nI am funny about public restrooms. I typically never use them, holding my bladder until I can get to a restroom that I trust and know (preferably at home), but the bathrooms here are always kept very clean. I usually stop here on my way back home from NYC, so I stop in the bathroom to freshen up before the long drive back. Now, its an old Harlem building, so keep that in mind, but you can expect a very well stocked and cleaned bathroom experience.\n\nCompetition:\nI don't fool with the other soul food restaurants in Harlem. No, ma'am. Only Amy Ruth's. Its been tried-and-true since Day 1. I love this place and the staple waitresses who have been working here for years. If you want good soul food, go to Amy Ruth's."

I ordered this plate of meatloaf with fried okra and I was utterly disgusted in the quality. I ended up throwing it in the trash. Meatloaf is supposed to be made with real ground beef. Instead, the meatloaf was made with artificial processed meat, similar to what you find in McDonald's and White Castle burgers. I've ordered the fried chicken wings plate and the wings taste like hormone infested wings from the Chinese restaurant. No seasoning, no crisp, just plain dry fried meat. They should be ashamed of themselves."

Collard greens a little sweet for me but the Mac and cheese was solid — not too salty. Definitely want to try their other sides. They gave me complimentary cornbread which was so sweet."

            "text": "It was vibe  was  there in 25th august on holiday for my nieces 10th birthday to NYC  from London so thought it be good chance to try soul food.\nThe waitress was so lovely very patient with us given that we hadn’t tried it before well authentic american soul food that is. Forgot her name but she’s a star\n\nEnjoyed candied yams (uk orange sweet potato basically)  very tasty it was a little bit too sweet for me  but that’s the points i guess either way it complemented my smothered turkey wings which was full flavour very savoury . I find turkey to be a bit drier than chicken but for me i was able to enjoy so thats a plus.\n\nSister loves vegetables so enjoyed the Okra\n\nThey are not stingy the chef wants to feed you because our plates were full  , you might feel overwhelmed but you won’t complain  about the portion sizes.\nMy niece couldn’t finish  her plate , it’s funny coz it looked like she didn’t eat it and unfortunately we couldn’t take it back because we had no microwave at the hotel otherwise that would have got waxed down for breakfast.  It’s a shame there was no kids menu coz that was a waste of food but thats fine because it seems like a more mature / adult setting .\n\nI did like there interior of seeing influential black people on the walls. Overall great experience , great food. I would come back\n\nLol love corn bread carried that back to the london🤣"

            "text": "After a day of exploring NYC (from Illinois) we found Amy Ruth’s after a quick google search of the best soul food near us. The description held incredibly true. The cornbread was warm and moist, the kind that melts in your mouth. We tried the fried chicken (thigh and leg) and my brother said it was the best fried chicken he has had in his life. The greens and Mac and cheese would be hard to rival, they were both packed full of flavor and perfectly cooked. I was highly impressed with each of our tables meal. We also had help from 2 incredible staff members with a totally unrelated situation, the only way I can describe them is angels! Thank you for your hospitality."

Had the Reggie bush, fried chicken dunked in honey, choice of white or dark meat, I went white. Very juice, very crispy, seasoning was so damn good, and the honey made it perfect! Comes with 2 sides. I had collared greens, first I've ever had and they were out of this world , and the candied yams were delicious! Can't wait to go back. Complimentary corn bread was delicious!"

            "text": "I came here because of the recommendation from a YouTuber.  The fried chicken is REALLY GOOD!!!  The flavor is just right, not too salty at all compared to a lot of fried chicken places.  At first I thought they baked or roasted the chicken before frying it because of the color and the texture inside, but they told me it’s just raw chicken fried.  Very interesting!  It’s not the juicy kind of fried chicken that I’m used to, but it’s not dry at all.  And I really enjoyed it with maple syrup — this is the first time I eat fried chicken in this way!\nThe collard greens really amazed me — I’ve never had this kind of flavor before!  Now I understand why I never liked southern American food before I came to Amy Ruth’s… it’s only because I’ve never had such good southern American food before!\nCorn bread also tastes pretty interesting.  I guess they put brown sugar in it?\nNext time I’m in NYC I really want to try the chicken and waffle and honey dipped chicken."

            "text": "🍗🧇 Amy Ruth’s lives up to the hype—again.\n\nThis was my second visit, coming back after almost two years—and I’m glad I did. I went for takeout this time, and while the place was busy (as expected), the process was still smooth. There was about a 5–10 minute wait to place my order, then another 15–20 minutes while it was prepared.\n\nThey did forget one item initially, but to their credit, they realized it before I even brought it up. When I walked back in, they acknowledged the miss, apologized, and handed it over immediately—no hassle, no attitude. That kind of ownership goes a long way.\n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles (with wings), cornbread, and mac & cheese—and the food was just as good as I remembered. Flavorful, rich, and distinct—Amy Ruth’s doesn’t taste like any other soul food spot. It has its own identity. The portions were generous, and they packed the takeout bag with care, including utensils and everything I needed.\n\nIt’s not cheap, but you get what you pay for. The quality, flavor, and overall experience make it worth every dollar. Two years later and still hitting. I’ll be back."

            "text": "Amy Ruth's is one of Harlem's last treasures. Genuinely southern and delightful. Easily the East Coast version of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. Mac, yams and greens are the best sides. The fish is fried to a crisp but they also offer oven-cooked versions. One of the best atmospheres with no embellishments. Great place for a celebration and/or large parties. In addition, the list of beers and wines is at a reasonable price and the starter servings are generous—you can share them. On the whole, the staff is friendly, fun and fabulous. Really glad we could rediscover this place. I can't wait to bring our LA cohorts here. KUDOS to the management for running a tight ship from front to back."

            "text": "Stopped by here during my second time visiting from Texas.\n\nOverall, the meal was rather disappointing. We ordered The Ludacris. Chicken was fantastic, but the Mac and cheese was overly salted and dry. The potato salad was sweet. The cornbread had decent flavor but was dry.\n\nVery big serving sizes. I split this with my mom; couldn’t imagine eating this all myself! The hand squeezed lemonade was wonderful. Our service was exceptional. Food came out fast.\n\nLoved the various hand painted murals of famous black figures in history. Lots of seating. Also enjoyed the different names of all the food items. Great selection of food to choose from.\n\nI likely wouldn’t return with how disappointing the sides were, would rather try another soul food restaurant honestly."

Not too sweet and the potato\nSalad was chunky just like how i want it, the coleslaw was also fresh, cabbage were crunchy and not too sweet ad well, they were all just perfectly seasoned. The chicken wings were also great! And the mac and cheese and thr fried shrimp, the cornbread were so yummy, warm and soft, we also had the banana pudding just a little too sweet to my liking , but basically they were all perfect!!!\n(We didnt get the chance to take a photo of the wings and fried shrimp- i think it was just 6-8pcs)\n\nCONS: the service was slow, its pricey for the portion size, yes its delicious but definitely\nPricey. I was disappointed with the leg quarter size, it was definitely too small."
