Their lomo saltado and tallarín a la huancaina are menu highlights for us, along with their ají de gallina bites. But honestly, everything on the menu is fantastic and we have yet to find something we didn’t like. The service is also fantastic. The manager began recognizing and greeting us like friends after our 2nd visit. We had my husband’s birthday dinner here, we brought our own cake, and they were extremely welcoming and did everything they could to make it special, including lighting candles on the cake and singing happy birthday. Thank you Harlemite!!"

The ceviche came in a light, soupy broth that caught me off guard at first, but the flavor was bright and citrusy, and the fish was super fresh. The arroz chaufa (Peruvian fried rice) was outstanding—even for someone who usually skips rice. We liked it so much, we ordered takeout a few nights later, and everything was just as good. The wings were perfectly cooked and flavorful, and the sweet plantains were caramelized to perfection.\n\nAnd I have to mention the sangria—fresh, well-balanced, and not overloaded with syrupy sugar or artificial liqueurs that usually guarantee a headache. You can actually taste the fruit and wine!\n\nBonus points for the garden out back—so cute and cozy. Harlemite is officially on my go-to list."

We started with Red Sangria, Causa Rellena and Yuca, then had Ceviche Harlemite and Tacocho for the main course. Loved the attention to detail - the red tables and well kept backyard, the little pink vases on the table in contrast to the vibrant yellow sauce. The ceviche was a highlight for me - very flavorful and tangy fish and shrimp with a bit of spice and Peruvian corn. Although I didn’t care for the flavor of the sweet potato served with it, the rest of the dish was fantastic. Service was excellent - we never felt rushed and the backyard oasis is a welcome contrast to typical noisy spots. Also, $5 beer specials is unheard of these days. Highly recommend for adventurous eaters who want a quiet brunch with a partner or friends - will be back!!"

I was quite surprised. ordered the Mofongo and I had never tasted it this way before. I enjoyed it, thank you. Sangria was also good, but make sure that they mix it before serving it. My waiter was cordial his name was Pablo."

Gluten free so sometimes Peruvian food can get tricky because of the soy sauce, but they’re always open to adapting to no soy or using potato flour. The back patio Is the perfect ambience with a nice breeze so enjoy your summer day!"

The one comment is that the Papa a La Huancaina was very low on flavor, both understated and no real seasoning. The potato was crumbly and the texture was slightly off. The croquetas are amazing, and we really enjoyed all the main dishes."

Happy hour drink specials and outside seating.  The place filled up and is popular. The waiters were busy but attentive."
