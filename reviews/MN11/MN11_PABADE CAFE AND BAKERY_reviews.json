            "text": "Much love to the sweet girlsies at Pabade this morning. Must be a family name! My friend and I are both independently in New York for an extended time for work and we hung out this weekend, stopping for a beverage before walking Central Park. The baristas recommended a spiced chai or a cortado. I tried the cortado w almond milk and my friend got a caramel matcha and a baked good. Very tasty, thank you! Rich body, just like I love. I’m not sure the price bc my friend paid but a cortado is 1:1 espresso:milk (2oz:2oz) and prob an up charge for alt milk. Xo. I am sad in retrospect that I didn’t ask about gf bakery options. I didn’t see any labels for the goodies or like prices as I said, but I saw vegan and flourless descriptions on the website around the time of writing this. All love."

            "text": "I recently visited this café after reading some rave reviews, but unfortunately, my experience didn’t quite match the hype, especially when it came to their croissants. I tried the guava croissant, which had an interesting and enjoyable flavor combination, but the croissant itself was disappointing, very doughy and bready rather than flaky, as a croissant should be.\n\nAs for the coffee, I was intrigued by their advertised “mocha pot coffee,” expecting a traditional home-style Moka pot brew. However, it turned out to be more of a chocolate syrup mocha, which wasn’t what I had in mind. While the staff at the front desk were friendly and welcoming, the coffee and pastries left a lot to be desired.\n\nIf you’re looking for a flaky croissant and a robust cup of coffee in the Harlem area, I’d recommend walking a few blocks over to Super Nice Coffee. There’s definitely room for improvement here, and I hope to see some changes in the future."

They make you feel like you are entering their living room.  And once you try any one of their many choices of sweets or coffee or sandwiches….you are hooked !!  I know I was and I look forward to my next visit.\n….to whoever reads this you must try this “diamond”.  Satisfaction guaranteed.!!\n\nLes"

I have that too, that's true. 😂\nAgain, it's not always easy to find a good place in a city you don't know so well. So Google maps is our friend... Or so we think, because I can't say it's always right...\nThat day, we tried to go to several of the places Google recommended but they were closed, or out of pastries, or were simply not appealing enough... Finally, we ended up at Pabade Cafe and Bakery. The place is super small. And it was packed because there was a soccer game. But we still could go in, order a few pastries and even sit at the corner of the bar: not so comfy but, at least, it was hotter than the outside!\nThe staff was so nice and they gave us free pastries on top of what we ordered because they were about to close. Unfortunately the pastries were just ok, really not worth going there on purpose. So was the coffee.\nThe price was fair too, not too cheap but not too expensive either for NYC standards.\nOverall it was a good experience thanks to the very nice people I met at the bar... but this is not a place I would think about recommending.\n\nQuality & taste: 5/10\nQuantities: 7/10\nAtmosphere: 4/10\nOriginality: 6/10\nRatio price / quality: 6/10\nService: 10/10\nHow I felt afterwards: 6/10\n\nMore on IG @runnerandfoodie"

They know how to uplift your spirit with their generosity, even when you know that they, like other small businesses in NYC, are struggling. Along with my order, I’d sometimes find a flan that’s creamy and nostalgic at the same time, or a box of scrumptious pastries (croissant with guava!). It’s generosity, pure and simple, but also confidence and pride, knowing that what they offer is really good. To the siblings behind this gem, thank you."

I called a couple days before the day of the meeting to place the order and coordinated with Diana, who is so lovely and sweet! She answered my questions with patience, adjusted the order based on accommodations, and threw in napkins, plates, cups, cutlery (which is really nice to not have to worry about). I'm so glad that I ordered ahead of time because the pastries go quickly and I see why! When I went to pick up, the items were ready, all the workers were kind and helpful, and I chatted with two patrons who expressed that I did good choosing this place--always a great sign! Needless to say, the folks in the meeting enjoyed the food immensely and I ordered an iced latte for myself that had the perfect balance of espresso, milky yumminess and sweetness :) My only regret is not capturing pictures because everything was assembled beautifully. Thank you Diana and everyone at Pabade, I will definitely be frequenting this cafe whenever I'm in Spanish Harlem!"
