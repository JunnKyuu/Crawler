I had the meatballs-dominican style- with rice and beans and maduros and a side salad. Simply delicious! The place was empty (we were there at 2:30pm) which made it even better. I love the atmosphere of the patio. Drinks were good. Prices very affordable. Michell was our waitress and she was simply lovely. Thank you to Wendy too. We are definitely going back soon.\nI almost forgot to mention. There is no problem at all with parking."

The nevezuelan lady at the front and manager are really rude and non comprehensive 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾\n\nEl arroz es literalmente concon pegado super seco y no hay manera de que te den arroz fresco xq quieren deshacerse del arroz que ya lleva tiempo en la vitrina , el servicio es pésimo. Jamas volveria a comprar en este lugar ni tampoco lo recomendaria no solo por el arroz seco sino por la mala calidad del servicio al comprador.!"
