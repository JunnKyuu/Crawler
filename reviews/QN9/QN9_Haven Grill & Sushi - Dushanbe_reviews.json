Should have known that it’s more of a shashlik place ( even though they serve sushi) but that’s on me. Plov was good as well as shashlik. Salads lacked flavor. I would go again if it’s a part of a larger crowd since there is lots of room."

Every single dish that came out was absolutely delicious and truly authentic, you can tell the food is made with love and tradition. We loved everything we tried! The music added such a lively and fun touch to the evening, and the overall vibe felt just like being with family. The atmosphere was so warm and friendly. The owners were incredibly welcoming, and a special thank you to Nessa, who was so kind and attentive. Highly recommend this place if you’re looking for great food and a great time!"

From the moment we pulled up, the valet service made arrival smooth and stress-free, and the staff was ready to welcome us with open arms. The atmosphere was beautiful — warm, clean, and stylish — and the music created the perfect background vibe without being too loud. The servers were so accommodating, helping us with seating, menu selections, and even customizing a few orders. They made us feel genuinely cared for, which is rare with a group this size.\n\nThe food was absolutely phenomenal — truly authentic Bukharian cuisine made with love. The kebabs, plov, and samsa were cooked to perfection, and every dish came out hot, fresh, and beautifully presented. And let me tell you — the sushi was a surprise hit! So fresh and flavorful, you’d never expect this quality from a Bukharian grill, and all of it was Glatt Kosher, which was important to our group. The chef even came out to greet us, which added a thoughtful, personal touch. The entire place was spotless, and everything ran so smoothly. It’s not easy to handle a party of 20, but Heaven Grill made it feel effortless. We’ll definitely be coming back — highly recommended for events and special occasions!"

The appetizer fried dumpling was good but the entree was bland and not recommended. I asked for chicken kebab and .50 chimichurri sauce the waitress never informed me that they didn't have it and gave tzaiki sauce only after I got her attention, otherwise I wouldn't get any sauce. She just served the food after waiting for awhile and we are the only other table in there.They're under construction and was very noisy, only then after we completed our meal they put their music on. Someone was playing their cellphone loudly the atmosphere and ambience wasn't there. We aren't coming back we paid, left and you couldn't pay us to return. 1 star well earned"

Food is tasty, prices decent, atmosphere great we thought. 1 star deducted for lamb ribs that were so salty we couldnt really eat them, and a common practice where they advertise hanger steak on the menu but bring regular beef [tender and tastes good but not skirt or hanger strak]....I recommend you try it....the liver shish was AMAZING!"

It is a Jewish restaurant which I think they were a little racisMe and my friend walked in without a reservation and a gentleman came and said this side is for reservations. He then proceeded to walk us outside and put us in a room like looked like storage or part of a coffee shop. We immediately asked him if we would be able to go to the main dining area because it looked empty and we were only two people. He said “do you guys really want to go ?” We said if you can yes because the area we were brought to felt like they were just putting us aside and hidding us from the rest of the crowd. He then said he was going to get in “trouble” for it. We were honestly so confused by the vibes it was almost as if they didn’t want people of color there. We felt rushed out and judged. We even tried making a reservation on the website and it let us at 7pm which means that they had space but didn’t want to seat us. Which was such ashamed because we enjoyed the food especially the sushi."

The flavors were vibrant and perfectly balanced. I highly recommend trying the mushroom ravioli as it was a standout for me.\nAlso, the French onion soup 🔥🔥🔥\nWhat truly impressed me was the affordability.
