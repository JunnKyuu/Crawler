            "text": "We bought two pastrami sandwiches on rye.  The meat was tender and delicious.  I've lived in the area over 30 years and always heard they were good but never tried them.   My mistake!  The sandwich was better than Katz's and a hell of a lot cheaper.  Next I try the pastrami.   I went back on Feb 24,2021 and got two more pastrami sandwiches as well as shrimp salad and Swedish meatballs.  The server was excellent as I did give him (indecision grief)  which he took very well and kept his calm around me which is usually impossible.   I tipped him two bucks.  The  bill ran over 35 bucks but it's cheaper than the delicatessen I went to  a few weeks ago.  The food is made fresh and all looks delicious.  I'm too big anyway and there's never enough time for all the food.\nRevisited 11/4/25 for two pastrami sandwiches.   It took longer than usual and my wife and were looking forward to it.  The sandwiches came out an i said to the server if i knew it was going to take so long i would've added french fries as well.  The bill came to $ 28.00 and i went home.  We opened only one sandwich which unfortunately was tasty but tough!  Disappointing, It'll be a long time before i go back.  Service,courtesy and store is clean and well stocked."

The pastrami was perfectly tender and flavorful, and the rye bread was fresh. It's a simple, classic deli sandwich done right. A great local spot for a satisfying meal."

The star of the show here was the carrot cake, which nobody has mentioned. It's probably the best carrot cake I've ever had in my life. I don't understand why this isn't viral carrot cake, like they should be famous for it.\nThey clearly respect the store and the customers, the place is spotless clean and organized so good a military sergeant would approve.\nThey are very friendly to everyone coming in. These guys are pros and know service. I will be coming back to try more because they have some good stuff here and it's worth trying out whatever else they have."

The service here gives Toy Story’s Buzz Lightyear; IT IS INFINITE AND BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS! The staff here are genuine Souls. So… today I ordered a Hot Corned beef Sandwich Via Uber Eats. I always leave a note so I can hopefully put a smile on the faces of everyone at Manor Delicatessen. I received a piece of cake with my order. What melted my heart (not my brain cells) was the note that was attached to the container! It was a heart drawn on a piece of paper. They truly appreciate and value their customers here. And let’s not forget how Amazing the food is here. Words can’t even describe how F^AWESOME THE FOOD IS. My GOODNESS. Food had me singing ME SINGING 🗣️ Ooh baby I can’t put it in words…Ooh heaven is a place on earth… it’s Called MANOR DELICATESSEN! It should be a Felanious crime how I keep assaulting the hot corned beef sandwiches here. Oh baby, don’t forget about the German Potato Salad 🤤🤤🤤… one more thing… The Service IS UNDENIABLY THE BEST! They value their customers, they are Authentically Authentic. On behalf of all New Yorkers, We need to bubble wrap this place. It is truly a gem. It is a blessing! Once again, A SPECIAL THANKS TO EVERYONE AT MANOR DELICATESSEN. Happy early V-DAY to all of you’s, and anyone who stumbles upon this review! 😘 MUAH! Go on now and visit Manor Delicatessen, you will never be disappointed. I MEAN THAT! Wholeheartedly ☺️☺️☺️.  I hope you all have a wondrous rest of your day, and magnificent weekend.\nLove,\nSYMPHONIE JUDEA K."

It just does not have that fall apart real kosher deli pastrami texture. That being said its very flavorful sandwitch. I definetly enjoyed it. I give the pastrami a 7/10"

I also got the Coleslaw which was too shredded for my taste but in terms of taste it was good.  If I'm back in the neighborhood I will go back to try some of their other prepared food."
