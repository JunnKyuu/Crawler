We willed our tired legs to walk the last few hundred metres to the blurry outline of the Harlem Tavern. After touching door we celebrated, as we knew a beer would soon be moistening our lips.\n\nBut further good tidings awaited us, as we discovered an awesome selection of food. I sculled my beer 🍺 and scoffed a Turkey Burger in mere seconds.\n\nFully sated, we were able to make it to the Subway and back to our AirBnB.\n\n5 stars to this wonderful establishment."

The drinks aren’t water down as well and they have a good selection. They play good music and it’s at a decent volume which allows you to actually have a conversation with the person you’re with. Service is a bit non existent when you’re inside. So it’s best to find a bar seat. Outside service was great"

Everything was delicious!! I’m so used to spending an obscene amount and being disappointed when I go out to eat but this place did not disappoint in either regard. Steak and burger were cooked perfectly. Gumbo was almost too salty but not enough for me to really care. I live 1.5 hrs away and I’m already thinking about when I’ll return."

Our total was $82.20 she charged $84.20, plus we gave her the 20% tip. She deserved it, but let us give it to you. She seemed to be the only waitress on the floor that I had seen, and it could have been a mistake also...all is forgiven. The atmosphere was a laid-back cool vibe.

I walked in around 2PM and the energy and hospitality was lack luster, as I was told to seat myself wherever. Initially I went to the bar where I was told happy hour does not begin until 4PM and only drinks will be served. So, I find a quiet spot in the corner between the threshold of the bar and dining room. The water glasses are already facing right side up on the table, and visibly dirty. I just asked for a clean glass, no problem. I’ll take partial responsibility for the fact that I was served a turkey burger with pork bacon on it. I ordered blindly without reading the menu, but I feel as though I should’ve been informed by my knowledgeable waitress. Regardless, I sent it back knowing they were just going to remove the bacon from my burger and reassemble it accordingly. To my dismay, my burger comes back with a hair on the plate. Mind you, it’s only 2PM. I’m sure it wasn’t intentional but at this point the cleanliness of this establishment is a cause for concern.\n\nIn the end my meal was compensated, and I was no longer planning to leave this review due to  their effort to rectify the situation. However, the opportunity presented itself when I was notified to leave a review😅"

What buffalo sauce is sweet? The wings are not crispy. They’re like pre-cooked then reheated with sauce. Definitely not freshly fried. This is sad because wings are so simple.\n\nFried calamari was mediocre and not flavorful. It’s missing something and poorly breaded. They brought it out 2 mins after we ordered so maybe it’s from a box tbh.\n\nShort rib was pretty good. Potatoes were good and the rib was tender. It needed a little more spice though, it depended too much on the sweet sauce.\n\nService was okay, maybe a little rushed because it’s so busy. They’re definitely understaffed.\n\n$75 including tip for 1 appetizer, 1 entree, 2 drinks. Definitely not worth it. I do not understand how their drinks are $14 in this area—we are not way downtown.\n\nIt was too early for the music to be blasting the way it was. This is NOT the place to have a conversation.

            "text": "Stopped by for quick dinner. The waiter seemed a little disinterested but it was later in the evening... The spinach dip was excellent! Creamy & cheesy but not too dense, pitas bread was garlicky and not oily which was a perfect pairing. Drinks were delicious, we had the white sangria. my only gripe was my cup had a gnat in it and some other mysterious floaties which were very off putting but after I got a new glass I didn't see anything else so I was fine. I ordered some sides as well, mash was standard but good flavor. The green beans were a little bland, not much flavor and crunchy. I guess I like my green beans cooked a little more. The people I came with enjoyed their entrees (burgers) and overall it was a pleasant experience. I would return if ever in town again."
