            "text": "Uno de los mejores restaurantes que fuimos en NY, nos gusto todo desde la vibra del lugar, la atención, la comida. Pedimos un catfish frito con un wafle (que sirvió de almuerzo y postre) y además un plato de otro pescado frito con dos guarniciones que fueron las verduras hervidas y un mac&chesse, del pescado me gusto mas el que vino con el wafle tiene mas sabor las guarniciones ambas estaban deliciosas pero el mac fue un nivel mas de rico. Pedimos un mitad te helado y mitad limonada muy rico que vino con un refill gratis otro detalle del lugar que además fue el único en dos semanas por USA que nos dieron algo de entrada para picar (que no nos cobraron) el cual fue el cornbread (pan de maíz) calentito con manteca. La atención como lo dije fue excelente, la camarera siempre con una sonrisa y preguntando como estaba todo. Reservamos pero no hizo falta, había lugares libres. Recomiendo compartir el plato, nosotros estábamos con mucha hambre y no pudimos terminar la comida de cada uno."

I took a chance and went directly to the restaurant. The staff greeted me kindly and explained that it would be a 10 minute wait. Meanwhile, they guided us to the outdoor seating area, which was heated. We were seated and greeted by our server, Dylan. He was great! He kept our drinks full, brought our food out promptly.\nI had the catfish, crispy and seasoned well with yams and mac and cheese. The yams  were sweet but not to sweet. The Mac and cheese was flavorful but could use more cheese within the dish. One of my daughters had the appetizer wings, hot and crispy however a little salty for our liking. My other daughter had the chicken and Waffles served with a leg quarter which was also seasoned well. Daughter #3 had the chicken sandwich that was hot and seasoned well with fries. The fries were standard but hot and crispy. Lastly, my husband had the pork chops, vegeterian greens and rice. 1 pork chop was fried, crispy but a little salty. The other chop was fried smothered I  gravy. I didn't care for the gravy but it was decent. The greens were great. Well seasoned. The rice was well seasoned  and fluffy.\nThis was overall a great experience!"

Le service a été efficace sans être précipité et le personnelle est resté attentif tout au long du repas.\n\nLe menu prropose un bon équilibre entre les plats de la cuisine soul food en incluant des spécialités qui viennent systématiquement avec des accompagnements de type corn brean , mac and cheese ou encrore Yams ( un peu trop sucré à mon goût). La présentation des assiettes était soignée et appétissante. La cuisson des ribs était juste parfaite, les portions sont généreuses.\n\nNous avons déjeuné à l'exterieure , le cadre est charmant , aéré et décoré dans un style propre à Harlem avec un fond de musique sonore r&B old school. L'ambiance musicale était agréable et le niveau sonore adapté à une conversation normale.\n\nUne belle expérience gastronomique, allant acceuil chaleureux et plats savoureux dans un cadre agréable."

When I asked if I can still sit outside at the time of being seated I was told that they had just filled up all the tables, despite my reservation I had made 4 days prior. I was confused and felt it was unfair, so I spoke up again a bit later and after some back and forth, I was told by the host I should have said something earlier, and it was too late at that point. I guess I get the short end of the stick by still showing up for my reservation. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with my experience here. Food was mediocre at best."

You can eat by your hands ~~"

Fried chicken was well fried with juicy meats but the fried batter was too salty for me. Overall I enjoyed the quality of meat itself but not as much for their seasonings.\n\n유명한 곳이라길래 호기심에 와봤습니다. 돼지고기 rib은 매우 부드러워서 고기가 알아서 부스러지는 수준이었는데 겉에 소스가 그냥 평범 달착지근한 소스라 전체적으로는 빛이 좀 바랜다는 느낌이었습니다. 닭튀김은 육질 좋고 부드러웠는데 겉에 튀김양념이 한국인 입맛에는 너무 짜서, 솔직히 케엡쒸랑 얼마나 그렇게 대단히 다른건지는 모르겠어요. 전반적으로 고기의 퀄리티 자체는 만족스러웠으나 양념이나 밑간 같은 부분들은 취향에 잘 맞지 않았던 한끼 식사였습니다. 가장 궁금했던 우거지(green collard)도 달달한 바베큐 소스로 은은하게 절인듯한 간이라서 개인적으론 좀 불호쪽에 가까웠습니다.\n\n이거 하나만 보고 할렘까지 놀러올만한 가치는 아니라고 생각하고, 다른 껀덕지로 할렘까지 놀러올 일이 있다면 이곳에서 소울푸드라고 파는건 어떤건질 경험해본다는 의미에서 한번은 먹어볼만한거 같습니다. 치킨은 한국꺼가 최고인거 같아요."
