I also tried the catfish tacos, which are big pieces of fried catfish inside tortillas with sweet sauce and coleslaw.  These were just too sweet and rich for me.  The drinks are also all too sweet for me, so I get water.  The people are nice but service is functional and kind of brusk.  Not really a problem if you come expecting it.  Great chicken."

I knew from the look of it that this was not the same as it was before, but i went against my instinct.   In the past the mashed potato was good but this was terrible.  My friend had the collard greens and she said it had no taste.  The corn bread tasted mushy. The chicken was good and that's was about it. I'm giving charles pan chicken a break for now,  maybe they will get better."

I’d say, it’s still pretty good.\n\nI always get the smothered fried chicken (extra gravy) with collard greens and macaroni & cheese. I used to get the yams but they’d been lacking in real authentic flavor so I skip them.\n\nCornbread 5/5. Tasty, right amount of sweetness, slightly fluffy.\n\nCollard greens 4.5/5. Pretty good, add some meat and I’d rate it a five. Seasoned well, cooked slowly and they’re not canned.\n\nSmothered fried chicken 5/5. My fave dish. This man can do the hell out of some gravy. Chicken is always cooked well and seasoned to perfection. Oh and I always ask for and they give me extra gravy.\n\nMacaroni and cheese 4.5/5. It’s been getting better since the expansion. Sometimes, it’d be good and other times it’s just okay. Right amount of cheese in it.\n\nFruit Punch 3/5. Typical koolaid. Not crazy about it but I always drink it. I wish they’d offer a half and half or Arnold Palmer. I’ll try the sweet tea one day too.\n\nOverall, I could write more, but an easy 5/5 for ME. I appreciate that he’s a southern black American man running this restaurant, lots of other soul food joints are ran by others. I have an old review from his old spot on Yelp, but this is pretty good. Keep up the excellent work sir!"

This fried chicken might not be what you're used to, but the flavor is incredible. Real dark meat that it crisp and not overly crunchy. That's why people love it! Cornbread is equally old school, not some fluffy stuff. Collards were excellent- meaty tasting and so tender, even the stems were soft to the tooth. The staff is friendly, professional and also entertaining. Will return soon!"

The chicken was pan-fried, so it was juicy, crispy, and flavorful without being greasy. The sugar cane on top was such a unique and delicious touch.\n\nThe drinks were refreshing — the limeade was my favorite, though a little sweet (I’d mix it with water next time). The desserts were sweet but still light, and the sides were all vegan — a healthier take on traditional comfort sides without losing flavor.\n\nThe turkey wings were fall-off-the-bone tender, and the jerk BBQ had the perfect balance of sweet with a little kick. I also loved the blackfish tacos, especially the sauce with that hint of sweetness.\n\nOn top of the amazing food, the staff was so kind and welcoming, even sharing a bit of history with me. Overall, such a wonderful experience — incredible food and even better people."

Top 10 chicken in NYC easy on anyone list\n\nBut to be completely honest I just ordered in and I really wouldn’t recommend it if you’re 20 blocks away it definitely didn’t hit the same. I have had this many times and it’s definitely one of the best fried chickens in the city.\n\nI’m not sure if it was cuz it’s close to closing time or just the delivery I’ll have to try and order it again soon to see definitely going to do it earlier to see if it’s better.\n\nGot the white rice (I definitely would pass on this) should have done the greens\n\nThe pees was ok\n\nThe Mac and cheese always hit\n\nThe corn bread was a bit dry but again I’m guessing it’s because of the time. It’s late so maybe it sat for a bit normally it’s top tear.\n\nI can’t blame them for the delivery especially since I’ve had it in person so many times and it was always consistent\n\nI definitely recommend this place definitely visit it’s many locations and you won’t be disappointed\n\nOrdering or delivery I can’t promise anything on that but if you go u will enjoy it.\n\nIG imbroke_rob\n\nThanks again for following me hope you enjoy the reviews"

The corn bread was very nice and nice. Not too crumbly and not too sweet. The two sides I got were also very good. I got a potato salad and a baked Mac and cheese. Both were very flavorful and not too salty. Overall, the sides were much better than their famous pan fried chicken.

Paid $19 for the meal which came with a generous portion of chicken and they give you the option of white or dark meat. Sides were enough to feed two people. Staff was really friendly and they even give you a wet napkin for after you eat to clean the grease from your hands. White meat is usually dry but this was moist and you could tell the difference between deep fried and pan fried. Gotta say what surprised me the most was the cornbread, came as the size of a softball and gotta say was the moistest cornbread I ever had, you could eat it without a bev. Their plates definitely can feed two people."

The yams, potato salad was oh so delicious.\n\nThen there's dessert...we chose the banana pudding. Now I have made banana pudding from scratch but this right here, its fluffy and delicious.\n\nYou know you're in serious trouble when even the lemonade and the ice tea is 10s across the board. 5 stars doesn't do it justice!\nThank you Charles for putting us into a food coma!

I knew I should have gone to the flagship location, but I decided to go to 125 instead. Bad move. Charles wasn’t there and he was always around the other two stores when I would stop in. The 1st girl seemed new but she was pleasant and welcoming. The other girl short with braids asked if I wanted 2 pieces with the plate which threw me because the plate comes with 3 pieces. Then she asked white meat or dark and proceeded to give me legs. I didn’t notice it with the smothered order but I noticed with mine. Then she takes the little tray for my chicken, so I say to her just give me the same tray you gave for the smothered chicken and she ignored me and proceeded to put it in the small tray that wouldn’t close and wrapped a rubber band around it. When I saw my chicken hanging out I asked for a bigger tray again. She apologized and told me that’s what she was told to do. Regarding the food. Chicken had a lot of fat and skin. Made me feel like it wasn’t cleaned. Chicken was missing something. The smothered chicken is usually cooked in the gravy but she took the regular fried chicken and poured dark gravy on top. Like gravy for the mashed potatoes. Not how Charles had it in other stores. Sides were delicious. Big portions."

But I’m tired of walking into spots in Harlem and being treated like my money don’t count just because I used an app and got the “discount” plate\n\nTwice now I pulled up to this soul food spot. First time, dude acted like handing me a bag of food was doing me a favor. Negative energy all through it. I’m outside, thinking about leaving a review, and suddenly he slides me a bag like I’m supposed to be grateful\nbut still with the attitude.\n\nSecond time, same story. Same person. Same vibe. I ordered heavy from this place before, paid full price, never had a problem. But the minute I use Too Good To Go? Different treatment. Like now I’m less than. Like I don’t deserve respect because I didn’t pay “top dollar.\n\nIt’s not even the food  food is good. It’s the way some workers move. I’ve met cool people in that same restaurant who show love. But one bad apple at the front can poison the whole tree. If I was the owner, I’d never let that slide. You don’t intimidate customers, you don’t make them feel small.\n\nHere’s the truth: you get more love from the Spanish spots or the white-owned spots on that app than you do from some of our own. And that hurts to say. But it’s real. I’m all for supporting us, but I can’t keep supporting a place that treats me like I’m begging. I pay for my food. Respect that.\n\nI’ll speak on this on my radio show, not out of hate, but out of love hoping somebody listens. Because at the end of the day, we should be treating our people better, not worse. Kindness don’t cost a thing"

What a waste of time and money. The staff took over 45 minutes to insulate us by packing burnt fried chicken and beyond hard catfish that couldn’t be eaten. The ribs were just boiled with no sauce and had a funny taste. I sent an email to the powers that be as the store manager of the 145th street location recommended when I called to complain. I felt it necessary to write a review especially after wasting $ 56.61 on food that I would not give my worst enemy."

The food selections were fried or jerk chicken with two sides and cornbread and everything was scrumptious. They even offered sweet tea-the table wine of the south.  What a sweet treat!\n\nThe women hosting and serving were so pleasant and helpful too.  I also loved that Mr. Charles was onsite too.  A true African-American southern experience....in NYC."

I come here regularly because the food is consistently amazing—each meal is freshly cooked and bursting with flavor. The homemade lemonade/iced tea half drink is a refreshing treat, and the signature homemade sauce takes the dishes to the next level. The staff is incredibly friendly, always going the extra mile to make sure every regular feels appreciated. If you’re looking for a satisfying, hearty meal that feels like a warm hug, Charles Fried Chicken is the place to be. Elaine is the manager of this spot and she’s super friendly! Elijah- the cashier is also super energetic and friendly. Highly recommended!"

The culinary offerings were exceptional, and the staff demonstrated both friendliness and professionalism.

The accompanying mac and cheese was equally delightful. I fully intend to return.
