From the oxtails to the short ribs beyond, everything was good! The live music with the older gentleman and his guitar and the drummer and bass player, definitely made the place lively and fun! Good food, good music,  what more can you ask for! Highly recommended..will be back!😋😋"

A wide variety of food,beef,pork,chicken,fish, seafood,fruits and salads. Not just your standard soul food staples. Its not a fancy place,more clean cafeteria style seating and you bus your own tables  I had several dishes like a whole fish that were very tasty. I tried several types of dishes and nothing was bad. I preferred the fish and jerk chicken dishes (not too spicy tho)and wish i had room for more veggies and dessert dishes. They charge more for meat only plates, $10.99(?)and cards pay an extra fee as most do now. There's not a lot of indoor seating but we went at lunchtime and there was plenty."

It's OK but fell off considerably. I just ate there and it tore my stomach UP. I had fried chicken, Mac and cheese and green beans with black eyed peas over rice with some avocados on the rice.\n\nThe cashier girl was unnecessarily rude too. She asked if I wanted a receipt I gave her a thumbs up she then ripped the receipt off and put it in the drawer and stared at me. I had to yell \"yes I want one\" because they have a band in there on Sundays. That's why I gave her a thumbs up. She then gave me a receipt and asked what that meant. She tried to act like she didn't know what a thumbs up meant. So weird to do all that.\n\nI had been going less because of the price now, the food quality and customer service has lost a once daily customer."

The macaroni had an off putting taste, and the cabbage had a weird flavor. I’m not sure who is making the food behind the scenes, but in no way shape of form was there any soul.. cashews were pretty friendly, but we will not return unfortunately Feel like I want to vomit.🤮"

We host a large luncheon every month at work, and I was hoping they could become a regular vendor for us, especially given their extensive menu. Unfortunately, the experience was very disappointing.\n\nThe chicken lacked any flavor—completely unseasoned. Both the mac and cheese and collard greens were also severely under-seasoned and bland. Surprisingly, the sweet yams were the standout; they didn’t look like much, but they had a nice balance of sweetness and were quite enjoyable. The cornbread was forgettable, and the potato salad had an odd, off-putting flavor.\n\nOverall, the food left much to be desired. Down right awful.\n\nI also need to add, the staff was very nice. All smiles and very helpful."

I drove from Brooklyn on a weekly basis to get their honey wings, fried chicken, greens...\nBut over the last few years and after my visit yesterday,  i am compelled to leave a comment. The beef short ribs and oxtails need more time in the oven; at least an extra hour! The. Short ribs were seasoned well as usual but they were so dry and tuff because that cut of meat CANNOT be rushed! The same for the oxtails, they were tuff! I noticed this also a year ago and i thought it was just a bad batch. Yesterday was the first time i came back in a year and it was still bad! I hope they read this review and make the adjustments.

Not only was both trays of mac & cheese burnt, but the cornbread was also and when we tried to call our number was blocked even when we sent the pictures to the manager. I ended up going to the restaurant the next day to complain and tell the manager that he blocked us and the food was horrible.. he said why didn’t we bring the plate back that day, even though he seen us take up to 45 minutes to get a ride with the food and to call the other store.

            "text": "Grabbed a plate from here while roaming around H-town. I wanted to try something new in the area. This place probably (maybe) had an open buffet prior to COVID, but like many places, now charged by total weight. I believe my container came up to about $30-$32 total. The best part of the food was probably the seafood rice. It was DELICIOUS and the pieces of calamari, lobster, and everything else in it was flavorful and chewy. The Mac and cheese was \"alright\", I was expecting way more flavor but it wasn't as flavorful as I thought. I enjoyed it, however. The rice was alright as well, I can't say that the veggies and rice were WOW, but it was doable. I ended up not eating it entirely, as it didn't really have much flavor. The ribs were delicious, I did enjoy it and so were the oxtail. The oxtail were very meaty and flavorful and tasted great. Ultimately, I'd have to give this place about a 3/5. While it was good, it wasn't really mind-blowing and for $30+ I was expecting way more flavor and taste. I guess it's a give and take, since most buffet places make food in bulk which I believe doesn't taste as flavorful as when it isn't prepared that way. You may enjoy it, you may not -- but I do believe there are better options out there for soul food in the area."

            "text": "So, first time eating here. I purchased some salmon, yellow rice, fish, corn, and some fruits. The rice was salty. However, the fish lacked flavor. The corn was decent. I was scared about the weight making the food expensive. However, $22 for fish and rice is a deal. A regular restaurant or store, you would pay at least $26, and it wouldn't have included the other items or even watermelon. Thus, it was worth the price. The quality of the food just needs some work based on what I got."

            "text": "I am furious 😡 I came from way uptown Bronx (literally a couple blocks away from mount Vernon) I wanted food from \"Sweet MaMa\". It's been years but I was hoping they were still Guud. They were closed down (plumbing issue). Then the closest soul food place was johnny Kaks (They were closed, didn't update that on Google maps, banner was old grey and worn out and there was scaffolding covering the location 🤦🏾‍♀️) 3rd times a charm right? Not in this case. I look on Google for another soul food restaurant and find Jacob. There was a line inside this tight space and it seemed as if the customers were raving fans so I called up my family and asked if they want a plate. The employees were VERY NICE I had 5 large trays, 3 small, and 2 dessert (small trays as well) one guy told me I can sit trays on the side. When I was in line to pay another guy made multiple trips to put my stuff behind the counter for me. I was there getting food for a while so after I paid i asked if I could use the bathroom and leave my food behind the counter. The problem is THE FOOD IS SPOILED. BASURA. The turkey wings and the corn bread taste and even smelled spoiled. The chicken is undercooked and was still bleeding. 😫 I was so tempted to go back to Harlem and ask for my money back. I also FOUND A HAIR IN THE PAN OF FRIED CHICKEN, I picked it up with the tongs and gave it to the guy just giving them the benefit of the doubt ( maybe it was from a customer). SO DISAPPOINTED AND UPSET. SUCH A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. MY STOMACH IS LITERALLY GOING THROUGH IT. THERE ARE SO MANY OF US WHO CAN DO 1,000X BETTER OURSELVES. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND OR GO BACK.  $100+ for spoiled food I'm so upset"
