This time it was overcooked everything. The seafood Mac and cheese pasta was so overcooked, it practically melted but it looked great and had a nice cheese crust on top. I think they left it in the oven too long. Also didn’t see any seafood then maybe crab and some cut up pieces of shrimp which was disappointing. Fried calamari was chewy like rubber bc it’s overcooked. There was a green weird looking fry in my fries so that wasn’t great either. We also got a slice of Oreo cake, it was delicious but very thin slice which is fine but yeah it didn’t feel great spending $$ this time."

Watching how the staff works together in a tight space and maintaining a clean working space, it should make sense why the wait is what it is. My favorite was the Mac and cheese.  It's been a while since I've eaten seasoned Mac.  The greens were tasty and tender as well. The fish was overcooked. Needless to say, the food was good enough for me to come back again to try the steamed option and the infamous lobster fries."

I’ve even heard the line is usually out the door.  I decided to give it a try especially with the snowy weather I knew it wouldn’t be as crowded.  When I arrived at the restaurant the staff was very welcoming and helpful.  The only thing that I wasn’t pleased with is the restaurant is taking cash only.  I was very disappointed especially since when I checked on the website on the menu it says they except cards which is why I’m taking off a star.   I had to use the ATM machine in the restaurant to withdraw money.  This isn’t a sit down restaurant to enjoy your meal, you order and take your food to go.  There is also a section to purchase seafood.  I was pleased they actually have whiting fish usually when I go to a seafood place, they tell me they have whiting but end up giving me tilapia.  The whiting was also filet so I was really able to enjoy the fish without worrying about any bones.  The fish was lightly seasoned and delicious.  The yams, cabbage, and macaroni and cheese were also delicious. I didn’t like the garlic mashed potatoes it had a weird taste to it.  I also didn’t like the collard greens very bland and a bit too hard for my liking.  The chicken was a bit salty and the skin of the chicken was rubbery but the honey BBQ sauce was good.  The portions are also a good size for the price.  The food is fresh and made to order so you have to wait a little while for your food so if you’re in a rush this may not be what you’re looking for.  Great music selection while you wait for your food."

As they were walking us to the table the lady that sat us was like what’s in the bag we said cupcakes she said oh you gonna have to pay $35 for bringing  that in here so we had to take the cupcakes back to car. (Again we called a few times during the week to get a better understanding of the rules and no answer) My aunt kept going back and forth from table to table. We ordered our food and drinks they kept forgetting my aunts friends orders first it was her drink then it was part of her food.We order an appetizer and it didn’t come till after we already got our food. The tables are too small to seat 5 ppl. My cousin stop by to just bring my aunt some flowers and she wasn’t allowed back where we were the lady that sat us told her we would have to come to the front to get the flowers I found that kind of crazy because she was literally bringing flowers and leaving.

You can see the attached receipt for the order details.\nThe music is a bit loud, so you must speak up when ordering. The cashier repeated each part of my order but the music remained a hindrance. The general appearance was clean and smelled well, despite the fresh fish cleaning. The wait was over 20 mins but should have been shorter, as I noticed the wings being tossed at least 10 minutes prior. Also, what turned out to be my order had been on the counter for more than five mins before my number (along with  four others) was called. It seems that there was a backup of prep and issuance of orders.\nWhen I got home, some 15 mins later, the food was still warm. The wings were fried hard (down to the meat) and I think that took away from the flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were tasty but not outstanding (I'll try them HOT for better taste). The collard greens taste about the same as most restaurants (I could taste the salt in them). As with the mashed potatoes, I'll try them HOT. I liked the texture of the porgy, the best (head on!). The meat of the fish flaked away easily. So, do try the porgy.\nNow, about the drink. There were four dispensers, with four flavors (blue, peach mango, strawberry pineapple and I have no idea). I tried the strawberry (it rang up as peach mango) and you'll be addicted. If, you like sugar in your kool-aid then this is your place. I tried it straight and 1/2 water. There has got to be a happy medium!\nOverall, I can see why Lighthouse is popular and you should give a try."

I’ve had aplenty soul food before (mostly in California) and this is definitely up there in my favorites. I’ve only gotten the catfish dinner plate and it’s so good I haven’t even wanted to try anything else; however, seeing everyone’s orders waiting for them I’m always tempted to try. something new. It all just looks so good. With that being said, it’s delicious and open late so inevitably there’s more than likely going to be a line/wait, which personally I have no problem with. I’ve reviewed them on Yelp because I think this place 100% deserves a good rating for their food, portion sizes, pricing (for the most part) and the fact they stay open so late, and it’s just funny to see people calling the food here “unseasoned”, “salty” or saying they “added sugar to the greens.” First of all, if anyone’s putting sugar in their greens that’s a red flag, and if the foods salty then I think that’s a conversation for you and your doctor.

What I was expecting was 4 pieces of fish, as stated, some fries, tartar sauce, and maybe a lemon wedge.\n\nSo I got four pieces of fish, but the fish they used wasn't cod or haddock. Instead it was some cheap white fish. It was bland and tasteless. They used a cornmeal breading instead of a traditional batter, and the fish was very oily. It came with a lot of fries. The entire order weighed easily a pound. But the fries were extremely oily and they were caked with the same breading used for the fish. Also, they didn't give me any tartar sauce or lemon.\n\nOverall, the food quality is very low. I wouldn't recommend it."

            "text": "Food is pretty good, but not worth the wait. More importantly it’s an easily solvable problem. No phone orders, no online orders. Not only does it make no sense for your customers to have to walk in to order and wait an hour with no alerts when it’s ready, but it means crazy double and triple parking all up and down the entire street. Update your ordering system. It makes absolutely zero sense other than just not wanting to.\n\nUPDATE: a year later. My elderly neighbors also complaining about the rats, the insane trash left all over the streets, the fights, the insanely bad ordering system. They can’t possibly deal with the chaos of that line, or think about ordering food here. So incredibly disrespectful to your neighborhood. Business is genuinely a problem on this block. Ask any other the other incredible businesses what they really think of Lighthouse and how they treat their neighborhood. So bad.\n\nUPDATE with new pics: many years later. Nothing has changed. Fire trucks can't get through many nights. Tonight garbage trucks triple parking just to pick up trash. Horns going off like crazy every time something like this happens. Every night. EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. Lighthouse is virtually flipping off all their neighbors and the hardworking people that keep this city going. It seems nothing will ever be done about this restaurant and its patrons that decide to jack up the entire block for hours on end."

Also, I suggest that you go and order food when you don’t have plans or wait in the car or outside because the kitchen is in display and you will smell like food. Their drinks are also worth the price."

One of the so called \"bouncers\" I guess, I don't know he looked tacky, got particularly upset because we were waiting for our bill to get settled since it was suddenly cash only and said that \"we wanted to act grown so start to act like it\" however no one said anything of the sort, we were just waiting for our bill. It's not worth coming here to dine in."

            "text": "Food - Good: Fish and shrimp is seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Pasta is tasty. The food is heavy, and plentiful. The infamous lobster fries used imitation lobster, which explains the low price for the quantity.\n\nService - Good: The ladies managed the kitchen well under the circumstances. Do not order the seafood platter or pasta if in a rush. Average wait time for most orders is 30-45mins.\n\nOverall - Recommend. This is not fine dinning or event a sit down. For tasty seafood in the area, it’s a solid option for take out/pick up based on flavor, quantity and price. One regular order of anything can possibly feed a family of 4."
