My son enjoys eating shrimp tacos, chilaquiles and churros. I enjoyed as well every signature dish and every artisan craft cocktail from El Kallejon. Also, El Kallejon hosts every year a Day of the Death Event where you can celebrate this tradition with music and folk dance. El Kallejon is a piece of Mexico in East Harlem. Nestor, chef, and owner is friendly and humorous. He describes his passion for his culture, food, music and traditions. Visit el Kallejon in East Harlem."

But unfortunately, the system forces me to give it at least one — and even that feels like a betrayal to every clean, competent restaurant out there.\n\nWe came in expecting a casual bite, nothing fancy — just some tortilla chips and dips to start. What we got instead was an abomination: halfway through the basket, we discovered eaten bones — yes, actual chewed-on chicken or ox bones — nestled in among the chips like a disgusting little surprise. These weren’t cooking mistakes or bones that slipped in by accident. These were clearly gnawed, already sucked-dry bones that looked like they came straight from another customer’s plate.\n\nWe immediately showed the staff, expecting shock, horror — anything resembling basic human decency. Instead, we got blank stares and were told, with stunning nonchalance, that we still had to pay for the meal. No apology. No refund. No sense of shame. Just the bill, handed to us like we should be grateful we weren’t charged extra for the “protein.”\n\nThis wasn’t just gross — it was unforgivable. The health violations alone should have this place shut down. And the way the staff handled it? Even worse.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Do not eat here unless you enjoy a side of someone else’s leftovers with your tortilla chips. Report them. Warn others. And whatever you do, don’t go near this dumpster fire of a restaurant."

Good mix of  safe bets and exotic adventures.\n\nDrinks - fantastic and creative cocktails\n\nService - slow for NYC if you are in a rush to get in and out, but perfect if you want to take the experience all in and enjoy the evening.  Think island time, but worth it for the attention to care in the food and beverages.  The owner, chef, bar tender, waiter may all be the same person at times (Nestor).  Loved it!\n\nAtmosphere - It wraps it all up beautifully. It's quaint and festive. Loots to look at on the walls.  Everything appears to be a personal work of art or decor. The small chairs and wood tables are fitting for the food, space, and overall vibe.\n\nI highly recommend it. I look forward to visiting again next time I'm in NYC."

You had to pay tip when your card was run even though tip wasn’t included on the bill. Nothing was easy. At all. Not worth it. Tons of other Mexican spots in Manhattan and Harlem. And I’m being very generous with this review. It’s not even the money. It’s the principle. Ruined our entire night."
