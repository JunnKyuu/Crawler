            "text": "My fiancé and I were so excited to try this place. We saw reviews online stating that the food was delicious. We came in on Wednesday afternoon at about 5:45pm. There was only one other couple seated to eat. The waiters took our order. We initially ordered the Vegetable Nem as an appetizer, and also ordered our entrees at the same time. Literally 25 minutes goes by and the waitress tell us they are out of the Vegetable Nem—— why did it take so long to tell us idk. So we reluctantly ordered the Brussel sprouts ( i’m pescatarian). They arrived another 20 mins later— they were SOOOOOO BLAND. No seasoning at all and with a tiny dish of what tasted like French dressing. We already knew from then that everything was about to be below standard. About 15 mins after that the waitress brings my meal, and I at first refused to eat because my fiancé didn’t receive his entree. After about 10 mins of me eating she comes over to use to confirm our orders….and we have to remind her of what his meal is! I am sure she never put the order in. After my fiancé’s insistence I eat so my food won’t get cold: I had the Atieke with fish. The meal was very subpar, flavors were off! I am Malian, I know my Atieke, this was NOT it. My fiancé’s food literally come another 20 mins later. He was so disappointed in the lack of flavor. His meal - the Jollof Rice w/Lamb literally came with 3 chunks of lamb with only ONE having actual meat and the other two fatty pieces. The waitress was apologetic and she did offer us a complimentary Crème Brûlée, which I mean was good- but not made fresh. I would NOT recommend this restaurant. We came all the way from Brooklyn to try it out left EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED. Don’t waste your TIME OR hard earned $$$$ in this economy."

            "text": "My most recent stay in NYC saw me being guested by a childhood friend who lives in the old stomping grounds of Harlem, east through west, that I grew up in.\n\nThough an attempt at gentrification — that seems to have stalled a bit — is detectable with the default introductions of homogenous staples such as Starbucks, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, et al, there are still homegrown, non-chain businesses that that have taken root and are starting to shine.\n\nOne of those places I discovered was directly across the street where I was Staying. It's called Azara Kitchen, and is the brainchild of Ousmane Compaore, chef and restauranteur from Burkina Faso.\n\nThe menu is touted as \"African and Mediterranean\" and boasts respectful representations of traditional dishes — expertly prepared and and impressively delicious — from those widespread and varied provenances.\n\nIn two nearly back-to-back visits, I was treated to a *maffe lamb* dinner dish of long-cooked on-the-bone lamb in an aromatically flavored peanut and vegetable broth, and followed that up with a booze-free version of tiramisu that finally offers my a more than rewarding opportunity to enjoy my second favorite dessert (after banana pudding) without the feel of sacrifice in taste or texture.\n\nMy second visit I was curious to to see how the globally ubiquitous chicken wings could stand out from the countless number of other iterations, and Azara's \"spicy sticky\" wings are uniquely seasoned and properly stand out from common wing editions by transporting the palate to places more exotic and authentic to the regions these globally individual flavor profiles get their inspirations from.\n\nIf I were still in the neighborhood, and possibly not even, Azara Kitchen, I would be a frequent visitor for not only the food and the obvious love that it comes from, but for the charming vibe and layout, accentuated by some well thought out wall art and an attentively pleasant staff.\n\n(That charm made it easy to make new friends with some other diners that happened to be sitting next to me, a frequent reward of dining solo.)\n\nGentrification or not, Azara Kitchen should be a neighborhood standout that should continue being a rightful success for locals and visitors for a great many years."

            "text": "Great place to take your taste buds on a tour of west Africa without leaving Harlem. With a sprinkle of Italy as they have the most amazing tiramisu ive ever had. The restaurant is clean and well maintained. The staff is amazing and if you're lucky enough the founder of this gem and creator of the delicious menu will come out & great you himself. For a lil inspiration ask him to share his story. As an entrepreneur myself I love to hear others speak of their passion ❤️. & in this case the chef lights up like a star so you know the food is going to be good. Theres always R&B /afro beats playing in the background creating a great vibe . Perfect for friends gathering or family outing and casual dates. Or if your a home body order take out. My personal fav is Cassandra's Poisson which is\nGrilled whole Branzino marinated with Azara's seasoning & served with grilled asparagus. Then for drinks I always get the ginger and the tamarind juice and mix them. Perfect half&half 👌"

Jollof was dry as well, no sauce/oil/dressing to go with it.\n\nThere was no Air conditioning. Big loud fans to compensate. Front doors/windows open.\n\nFlies everywhere. Probably because of the window/door situation.\n\nThey charged us for water. We asked for tap explicitly, they gave some explanation that Harlem tap isnt good. So you’re cooking with bad tap water but if we don’t pay for water we get none of it? Basically a scam.\n\nBathroom was filthy. Paper towels, toilet paper on the floor. Sink drain had paper in it, so sink was filling up.\n\nNot a single apology or amends was made for the awful meal. The staff has the fake nice/plastic smile thing down as well.\n\nI try not to leave reviews but it was so bad it feels like an injustice to not say something."

Right there on Malcolm X Blvd ( Lennox Ave), the place was nicely decorated and very clean. You must try their house-made juices. The Baobab & Bissap, I tried, and they were delicious. They also have Ginger & Tamarind juices, as well. For entree, I had Cassandra's Poission, EXCELLENT. My wife and cousin had their Jolof Rice with Fish, EXCELLENT as well.The fish was Branzino cooked and seasoned to perfection! I will be back. 😋😃"

I thought the flavor was decent and the dough was extra doughy which was good if heavy. I was more reminded also of Bengali shingaras, which are decent as long as not too heavy. I could've said more filling but actually as a snack it was fine.\n\nI also got the dibi lamb. The lamb was way too dry, and the jollof rice was also dry. My guess is these were both made in much bigger batches, which is fine. But they were made with too little moisture to account for the loss of moisture when reheating. Put another way, the food was slightly nuked and that led to an oily dry lamb and a crumbly rice. I wonder what these would've been like fresh. For the dibi lamb, I looked this up because I was curious why the dish was so seemingly simple, and I think the mustard sauce is missing. Without it, this is a very oily stir fry, where the subtle flavors of classic Senegalese food are lost in the dense fat content.\n\nOverall an OK place, I think if I go back I want to try one of their sandwiches, which should be less oily and thus more representative of what they're going for. Or I may just go for a snack and try their vibe as a reading/working place. But the mains are just not at the level I'd expect for Senegalese food in Harlem. Not yet, at least.\n\nP.S. Actually, I wonder if it's the fish I should get, right ..."

My reasons for the 4 stars instead of 5- the quantity of food is less than I am use to especially African restaurants. The fish was pretty small for a dish that is pretty much $30. Beyond pouring water and bringing the food there is no further interaction or inquiry by the cashier/server. Regardless of those things I will definitely return.\nReturned August 1th:\nJust as before, the food was very good. I don’t realize that there is a plate where you can order an entire Bronzino fish if I want more fish. Beyond that I enjoyed the couscous made from cassava which I mixed with the pickled salad that I had. The plantains were cutting nice bite-size pieces and the pepper sauce added a nice flavorful kick to the fish. I ordered the tiramisu for dessert. It was OK but next time I’ll try the red velvet."

            "text": "Stopped by this new restaurant not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Right away you’ll see the place is thoughtfully furnished and decorated, and the staff are all in uniform and very nice. They only had a limited “soft opening” menu and the only African dish I noticed was the Jolof rice which was delicious, as other reviewers have said. I was drawn in by the prospect of African food but was surprised to also see on the menu things like avocado toast, steak and eggs, salmon, Caesar salad, wings and other things you’d expect to see at many American fare restaurants. Although they did have plantains as a side dish which were also great (if you like them soft). Great service, great food, and I’m looking forward to when they start offering a full menu. Great addition to the neighborhood!"

The waiter was super sweet and I ordered the lamb egg rolls and enjoyed them while waiting for the jollof and fish to be completed. The jollof and fish tasted really good however it unfortunately gave me really bad food poisoning which I experienced while I was walking back home. This was my only meal for the day.\n\nI immediately contacted the restaurant and the waiter took down my contact info and said the manager would call me back which did not happen. So I called back and had a polite conversation with the manager, I heard her bring this up to the owner and she asked what could be done on my behalf in which he said “food poisoning takes 1-3 days and is not immediate. And it is not the restaurants fault I got food poisoning. That is INCORRECT information because poisoning symptoms can start anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 weeks after eating contaminated food.\n\nI’m posting this because hearing the owner take no responsibility was dismissive and more importantly I didn’t know going to his restaurant meant I would be given a laxative 🤷🏽‍♀️😒😩"

            "text": "It was a fun experience. I went with one other person and we both agreed it was pretty alright.\n\nWe shared beef and lamb nem as well as the Attieke Poisson. I also got a Baobab Juice.\n\nThe beef and lamb nem were alright. It was like a crispy roll with meat, vegs, and glass noodles inside. I thought the texture of the roll was perfect, but I didn't think the meat was savory enough to make me satisfied.\n\nThe Attieke Poisson was couscous, fried Branzino, salad and fried plantains.\nThe fried Branzino was done so well. The crust was delicious and had bite and flavor. It paired so well with the fish. I wish the fish was cut length wise along the spine instead of width wise to make it easier to work around the bones. Just a couple of cuts around the fish mightve made it a more comfortable dining experience.\n\nThe couscous I thought was a bit strange. It was kinda dry and pretty acidic. I'm not too sure what it was supposed to be eaten with too.\n\nThe little salad was fine, but it was sitting in a bowl of oil which felt unhealthy to me. I'm not sure if it really added much to the experience but calories.\n\nThe fried plantains were done to what I'd expect of them.\n\nThe Baobab Juice was so good! It was a thick refreshing liquid with some tang. I love the texture of it. A little like a smoothie."

            "text": "I ate here months ago and the food was good, which is why I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1. A few days ago I went there again and the food (rice and fish) was so salty it was barely edible. Also the service is extremely slow and lackadaisical. I'll give them another chance but they need to get it together. Les Ambassades over on Frederick is way more consistent and better."

Special shout outs to Ousmane the owner and Kojo. They treat you like family, the vibes are immaculate. I will definitely be back and bring all my friends and family. I had the grilled branzino, the fufu, the souya and attieke. Nothing you order will dissappoint , I didnt want to leave!"
