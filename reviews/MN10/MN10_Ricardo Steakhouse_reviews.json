We ordered what’s supposed to be the OG of steak — it came out dry, flavorless, and definitely not worth the price. The sides were just as bad, and no one seemed to care when we mentioned it. For a place that markets itself as a steakhouse, the quality and professionalism were both trash. Save your money and go somewhere that actually respects its customers and their food. STAY AWAY FROM MELINA."

Julio, the bartender, is nothing short of professional and masterfully crafts every drink. Samantha, without a doubt, is the best server I’ve ever had; she knows how to make every visit fantastic and fun. The vibe here is lively, with great music and an inviting atmosphere that keeps you coming back. The location is wheelchair accessible, and they offer top-notch, 5-star experiences every time. Personally, I’m obsessed with the shrimp and grits—absolutely delicious! I can't wait to return soon. Hands down, Ricardo Steakhouse is a gem!"

The manger truly picked a great team of people\n\nMy partner was little concerned at first because we sat small little table and thought the table would end up being crowded but the staff was extremely quick to pick up plates , drinks, dishes as they are finished so and the next course comes out it's not crowded. They refil waters quickly too.\n\nThe staff does there great but don't expect to have any conversations with your server because it's high volume. Lol . If you don't know what you want as they come they'll come back to you❤️\n\nEverything from food to drinks was perfect"

Upon our reservation we were seated immediately, which was a huge plus! Shout to the matire d! Then about 10 mins after being seated, my party and I tried to get the attention of any waiter/waitress so we can place our orders. There were so many waiters that at one point they were on top of each other and or in like a huddle. 15 mins later we were able to place our orders. The food and the frozen drinks were good! However, upon gathering our belongings to make our exit, there were 3 roaches the came from the plant pot. We’ve got the attention of one of the waiters and about two others whispered and pointed to the roaches crawling around on the floor. To excuse the roaches appearance and to rectify the situation our waitress gave us a round of free shots for our party of four. I would have rather money off the bill."

We visited Harlem, NY and stumbled upon The Ricardo Steak House. Parking was scarce by it being a Saturday evening, but as I spoke to the maitre’d about the best place to park, a spot opened up right in front of the restaurant and she told us to park there and come inside and enjoy our meal. The atmosphere was lively, 90’s music mostly R&B, and we noticed groups of friends and family dressed nicely and gathered to celebrate certain occasions. The food was amazing, everything was well made seasoned to perfection and they also had a nice wine selection. Our waitress was nice, polite, and had a razor sharp memory and helped make our first experience at Ricardo Steakhouse very pleasant and memorable. I don’t remember her name but I do remember she was from the Bronx. I give Ricardo Steakhouse Five out of Five Stars‼️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

The atmosphere was comfortable while playing music. I highly suggest reservations if you have a party of over 4 people. I went on a Thursday around 5pm and the restaurant wasn’t crowded.\nLet’s talk about the entrees: I ordered the lamb chops with spinach. The lamb chops were tender and seasoned well! I highly recommend it!! The spinach was sautéed with garlic, delicious!!! My son ordered the pork chops and he said it was so good !! It was his first time eating grilled pork chops remind you he’s a picky eater. My daughter had Alfredo with salmon and she barely had leftovers.\nI ordered you don’t know Jack cocktail, it was refreshing. I don’t have any complaints but again I highly recommend reservations, especially on weekends."

The place is not to big, but not to small. There’s three bathrooms which one is kinda hidden behind a curtain next to kitchen so it’s a lil weird to see especially since the lights were dimmed, the other two are off to the back area, didn’t really like the setup, some weird guy was drunk and came knocking on the door immediately after I went in, mean while my peoples was sitting at our table in the front area!!! The food was delicious and the happy birthday dessert was also good (not free), the margarita drink was strong and had a good taste. I think people over hype this place up, maybe I will try the brunch one day. I would agree with others the music is LOUD but the DJ was rocking!!! Also the menu is limited not huge selection of options so don’t expect to come and get wings and all lat other kind of finger food appetizers 😂😂😂😂 cute spot tho, mad face tooo 👀"

The best thing to do is definitely make a reservation otherwise the wait is crazy or you might get turned away. The service was great they checked on you almost every 6-7 minutes filling up your waters, relighting the candle on your table etc. The food was great it came out super hot not just waiting in the window. I ordered pasta but wished I had ordered what the other tables around me had ordered. My food was good but theirs looked great. I recommend you going there. It was worth the price.

They definitely add a safety vibe to the place. First time patroning a restaurant with bouncers.\nShould have given me a clue about what I was walking into.\nSooo, I was here to meet up with my girls. Having the semi annual girls night. We were booked for a party of 12. Ofcourse, there were the usual stragglers despite tricking them into getting there a whole half hour earlier. Ricardo’s had us booked for 5:30 but since the majority didn’t get in until 6ish, we were set up at a make shift spot. My guess is that they over book in the event, one party pulls out they don’t lose the money. No problem with that. All about clocking dollars. Unfortunately, the space was tight and not convenient for all parties to converse. Not ideal but not a deal breaker. As the night wore on, shit started getting “real interesting.” For one, as you enter, you have to make your way through a sea of dudes. I mean full on body contact. It was the exact same thing exiting too. In fact, I had to wait a few minutes for people to make their way out of the door.\nOnce we were seated, it was on and popping. Where do I start. The floors-were straight up ICKY STICKY!!! I could hear and feel my shoes pulling with each step from whatever had spilled and semi-dried.\nThe menu, felt as if it were literally taken from a table from patrons who had just ordered right before I received it. Had to wipe the greasy film off of it.\nAgain, another red flag BUT I’m not one to abandon ship before I get the full experience. I like that there was a nearby door, however, I noticed it wasn’t labeled “exit.” Always looking for an escape plan in the event something pops off. Besides, where I was seated was too far to make it to the front entrance.\nI knew what I wanted before I even got there. We selected from the pre-fixed menu. I chose the skirt steak and and potatoes. I order a watermelon cocktail-a pinky something. Here’s when it went all the way left for me. For one, the waiter brought the plates and each person had to pass the plates to each other.\nThe steak tasted as if it was drowned in garlic powder. I LOVE garlic but this was over powering and I am not a picky eater AT ALL. The potatoes tasted as if they were over microwaved but semi edible. How can you screw up a salad? The salad was submerged in vinegar with a hint of olive oil.\nThe drinks though…🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️\nThe waitress sits all of the drinks down on one end of the table, and proceeds to leave. Immediately, my sister stops her and asks her, which is which. She makes an effort to tell us as she picks two or three of them up, looks at them and takes a few guesses. Must have gotten overwhelming for her because she eventually gave up, walked away, hands in the air, mumbling, “I don’t know.” And guess what, we had to pass the drinks down to each other AGAIN!!!” To add insult to injury, one of my sisters does not even drink, two of them ordered the same drink but one was virgin and the other was not. Thank goodness the one who ordered the virgin wasn’t on the wagon. We, the patrons had to figure it out!!!\nWhere they do that at?!\nThe drinks were straight up, DISAPPOINTING!!! And that says a lot coming from a straight no chaser tequila drinker. There was all bottom shelf liquor, it wasn’t even the liquor that was advertised either. Tasted like a mush mosh of alcohol, a few ounces of juice and a few pieces of ice. I have no problem paying good money for a quality drink. I paid $18 for trash.\nAt that point I was just done. The one saving grace was the music. Whoever was handling that-was on point.\nI do like that where I was sitting it was a diverse crowd. Asian, Caucasian, a woman and her family celebrating her 80th birthday and a few gay couples.\nI highly recommend this place to anyone in their 20s, 30s or 40s or if you’re looking to hook up.\nIf you prefer a more quiet intamate spot, this is not the place for you."

Nice, fun almost club-like atmosphere. The music was a little too loud but the DJ made fun choices. Wait staff and hostess were very friendly and attentive. Would definitely return!"

            "text": "Needs updates.\n\nThe food here is consistently good and thats how they’ve managed to maintain their popularity but they’ve clearly outgrown the space. It’s crowded, tight, loud and uncomfortable.\n\nCame for a birthday celebration with a party of 11. Our party was on time except for 1 person. They insisted we couldn’t be seated until the last person arrived, however they assured us our table would still be available when they arrive. The person arrives 5 minutes later. The space was so crowded the table operator confused us with another party and seated them before us and blamed it on “their system being down”. We all waited in the tiny wait area on top of other people waiting. They kept telling us 10 minutes knowing the wait would be longer.\n\nIn the meantime i sat at the bar and TRIED to have a drink while we waited and couldn’t even do that. The bartender brushed me off as he was making drinks for the entire restaurant and still had to make drinks for the people in front of him. 1 bartender for a packed Saturday night is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nStill waiting and growing bored i start recording the chefs in kitchen as the kitchen is right in front the bar. The manager walks over to me and starts hovering…\n\nAbout 15 minutes later they put together a make-shift table in the back of the restaurant   in a corner where we could barely squeeze into our seats. The waiter then gives us regular menus when they had arranged prefixed menus for us. The night was chaotic and we could barely talk amongst ourselves because the music was so loud. There was a speaker directly over us. The only thing good was the food.\n\nI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR LARGE GATHERINGS Or even an intimate date night where you actually want to have conversations"

We ordered two mojitos. I got the filet mignon, my partner got the ribeye. We also got the mashed potatoes side dish. Everything was really yummy. Highly recommended going here. I will definitely be returning and trying their different dishes."

            "text": "So, my best friend decided she wanted to celebrate her birthday at this restaurant, and I jumped in to plan everything about three weeks ahead of time. You’d think reserving a table wouldn’t be too hard, right? Well, it turned into a whole saga. I called the restaurant multiple times, only to be told their system was down. After what felt like an eternity, I finally got a confirmation text to set up the reservation. You can guess the twist—just a few days later, they told me they couldn’t accommodate us after all! Talk about a rollercoaster. But, in the end, it all worked out.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the vibe of this place—it’s absolutely **amazing**! The music? Oh, it hits just right. We were a party of twenty, so they made us choose from a pre-fix menu, which was $80 per person. The food was phenomenal, but here’s a major bummer: my husband found a long hair in his salad. Yep, he had to pull it out of his mouth! The waiter apologized, but honestly, he didn’t seem too concerned about it.\n\nOn the bright side, the drinks were delicious and expertly made. However, the night took another unfortunate turn right after we received the cake. The staff approached us and said, “we don’t mean to rush you, but we have several people waiting for these tables.” I cannot stress enough that this was as we were still enjoying our dessert. It completely ruined the vibe and left a sour note on what should have been a fantastic evening. Overall, it was a mixed bag, but we made some great memories despite the hiccups!"

They could turn the music down just a little, other than that it was a great dining experience."

BUT THEN I got a call back immediately from a wonderful concierge/host named Chris. Chris was so dutiful, gave me excellent advice on dates and times, helped me pick the best table, offered me insight on the peak hours of business (for my birthday of course we want the best!) Chris did not let me down at all!! Held my hand through the process, was super patient when I needed to call the restaurant 4 times in one night, helped me reserve space for 2 events!! and offered me an honest opinion when I asked for it!! things a good-natured person would do any day, Chris is the bomb dot com!! make sure to say hello when you stop by. oh, the music and the food are excellent too !!"

The food is served with great presentation but lacked flavor. I ordered the red snapper with mashed potatoes topped with shrimp. The filet of snapper was buried in a huge lump of mashed potatoes, hard as it was overcooked. The filet was not as the the index finger. It was then covered by grilled shrimp that had no flavor. The plantains were good. The lamb chops were just ok. They lacked flavor. The music was entertaining as crafty cocktails flowed. There's security standing at the entrance guarded with a chained across sidewalk. Really? However, It appears to be popular for sure."
