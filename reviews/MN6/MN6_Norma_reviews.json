If you're looking for authentic Sicilian food, definitely visit this place. It's a cute place for date night in the evening or casual eating during the day. Try the Bruschetta and the Prosciutto pizza!!"

The lasagna was a standout!\n\nBut what truly elevated our evening was the service, especially our waitress, Alessa (I hope I’m spelling that right!). She was absolutely wonderful. Attentive, genuinely knowledgeable about the menu, and full of great wine recommendations. Her warmth and charm made us feel like welcome guests rather than just customers. It’s rare to come across someone who clearly loves what they do, and she brought an extra layer of hospitality that made our dinner unforgettable.\n\nWe’ll absolutely be back! not just for the amazing food, but for the heart and soul this place puts into every detail."

We sat, we ate, we laughed, and I had the pleasure of meeting Stefano and the wonderful staff.\nThe atmosphere, the way the team works together, and the level of service are all absolutely top-notch.

Our waitress, Alessia, never smiled or greeted us, just asked for our order and then later brought our check. When we asked her about some of the dishes she almost seemed bothered by it. She was all smiles with her colleagues. Not sure what she didn't like about us. I asked the host at the door if there was a manager on site, he said no and kept on walking. Didn't bother asking if I needed anything. Must say these people like the host and Alessia needs to go through customer service training. I have been to Norma's before as it is in my neighborhood. But never again thanks to Alessia's lack of service. Only good service was from Miguel."

It is so cute inside and a well thought out space but the food is definitely the star here.  We were served fresh crusty bread with olive oil immediately after sitting down.  We started with an arugula salad with pears which was well seasoned and heaping in fresh Parmesan cheese. I had the lasagna which literally melts in your mouth, the pasta is paper thin and layered in a delicious ragu. My husband has the pasta trapanese pesto. The pasta noodles were cooked all dente and the sauce was fresh and light.  Every single thing we had was a 10/10. Will def be back!"

Great cozy ambience.\nHowever I am giving  a 4 star because i wonder how i ended up paying 30% tips went i had chosen 20% on the machine. Didn't notice the amount until i left the restaurant.!"

The crust was perfectly cooked and was fluffy and slightly charred. Based on flavor alone, the pizza may have been the best thing I have had in the city. My friend really loved the lasagna he ordered. We both were stuffed after we had our meals. Additionally, the servers are very friendly and the restaurant has a beautiful brick walls and feels like you are in an old Italian family’s kitchen. I loved it!"

The potato croquettes were good and had solid flavor. The pizza is where things went downhill fast. The margarita pizza sauce 100% tasted like Campbells. I was shocked. Not my preferred flavor. The Quattro formaggio was okay but I’ve had better. Would I personally get pizza from here again? No."

L’unica cosa che non ho apprezzato tantissimo era la nota di pepe che abbiamo avvertito, probabilmente proveniente dal sugo! Comunque voto altissimo! Impasto buono e leggero!\nAbbiamo provato anche il tiramisù, molto buono anche quello! Ve la consiglio."

Then came back two minutes later to take my order, I wasn’t ready then it seems as if she left with an attitude. I ordered an eggplant pizza and it was horrible, soooo soft and not tasty at all…. Never ever felt so uncomfortable. It was my little birthday dinner with myself after leaving the spa. Today was going so well, my me time birthday until now, I am super annoyed🤯"

The pizzas were lukewarm which was the only downside. We also got the pesto pasta and eggplant appetizer which were all very good. You need to ask the servers for complementary bread and olive oil."
