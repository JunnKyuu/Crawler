I enjoyed all the flavors of the big breakfast minus the hash brown, it was giving a strange oil taste. Wasn’t a big fan! I really enjoyed the flavor of the beans and the mushrooms- probably my favorite part. The sourdough was spongey and delicious, I ordered a side of butter to go with it and boy was it delicious! The banana bread was to die for, at first the butter had a strange fruity taste, but after a couple of bites I actually started to like it! The banana bread is so moist and flavorful, I like that they toast it before serving. I wasn’t crazy about the chai- a little too watered down for my taste. For not being a lot of people the service was on the slower side. They also seemed to be changing shifts."

I ordered the pineapple mint juice, which was refreshing, and the fried chicken burger with fries, plus a side of bacon jam. The fries were crispy, medium-thick, and paired well with the truffle aioli. The chicken burger was tasty, but a bit messy; there was a little too much coleslaw.\n\nMy mom had the Ricotta Hotcakes, and I tried a bite. They were soft, fluffy, and perfectly sweet. Served with bananas, cream, and syrup, they were a standout! I don't know if this place is anything to write home about, but it's good."

I keep telling myself that I should diversify and provide a more accurate review, so I will update my review if I ever end up not being a creature of habit. I think the Murray Hill location makes fantastic use of the small space they have! However, if you come at a busy time, you will be able to hear your neighbors' conversations because the tables are very close together.\n\nThe Big Breakfast ($20) comes with two eggs, bacon, mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, baked beans, hash brown, and sourdough toast. Everything is flavored very well, especially the mushrooms and the beans. The hash brown has been perfectly fried every time I have it, though it needs ketchup. For the tomatoes, I prefer them without the stems, and have had mixed experiences with that execution. The last time I went here, the toast was also over-toasted and seemed to not have butter on it, so it was very dry. I just think this is such a filling, tasty, and balanced meal!\n\nService at this location has always been welcoming! I have had people check in on me each time. They give you water, so they don't need to worry about water refills."
