We had to flag down a waiter after first sitting down for a while to get water and our order taken. After finishing our main course, we were rushed multiple times to pay our bill and was then directly asked to give up our seats because there was another party waiting, even when there were other tables open. Unless you tell us in the beginning about a time limit on the table, it's outrageous to rush or ask customers to leave."

            "text": "New favorite ramen spot!\nAmbiance (5/5): Sleek dining room with high top seating facing the windows or bar seating, or regular low seated tables. The establishment was only a third full on a random weeknight at 6:30p so it was very quiet and peaceful.\nService (5/5): Our server was manning the bar and also attending to a few tables. Since we sat at the bar, we were serviced quickly and often! She was very friendly and checked in with us at the perfect cadence. She even suggested using their special hot sauce when we were eating and it definitely elevated the meal.\nThere’s a dinner special of 1 ramen and 1 app for $30 (some of the options were extra $) so it only makes sense for some of the combination orders.\nPork Bao Buns (5/5): WOW, the pieces of pork were generous, thick but also super super tender. The sauce was creamy and the bun was soft/fresh. It has to be one of the best pork buns that I’ve had!\nTan Tan Ramen (5/5): Holy smokes, this is one of the best ramen I’ve had in the city!! The ramen noodles were a perfect chew and bounce which soaked up the rich sesame broth. The broth is so savory and packed with tons of flavors at once. Half soft boiled egg.\nSpicy Tonkatsu (5/5): I liked my tan tan more but this ramen was equally good. Half soft boiled egg.\nSecond visit: The waitress remembered me!!\nTsukemen Ramen (4/5): This was a bit of a letdown compared to my first visit because: the soup was not hot enough and the thin slice of meat in the bowl was less impressive. The noodles were superb (cold as supposed to be). There's chunks of meat in the broth that were tender! Half soft boiled egg."

We found this place and were excited to try food from Morimoto as we have seen him on Iron Chef. The tonkotsu ramen was delicious, but karaage had some parts that were too hard to bite through. The spicy tuna roll was excellent, the tuna itself was very fresh and high quality, and the roll did not have too thick of a layer of rice. We came with our 1 and 3 year old, and the staff was kind and accommodating, but they had no high chairs and the booster seats offered had no straps. If you come with a wiggly baby or toddler, expect to hold them with your arms."

Next was the Spicy tonkotsu and it was excellent. creamy broth and buttery rich noodles made it so delicious. the egg and pork were cooked to perfection. and the sides like mushrooms and such were also paired nicely with the ramen. ten out of ten experience and i would definitely come here again. this place BLOWS all other ramen shops out of the water. definitely recommend eating here."

I was seated at the bar so I get a chance to look at the sushi master.\n\nFood: Lunch special includes 1 ramen and 1 appetizer.

I emptied my bowl because it was so delicious.\n\nSALMON AVOCADO ROLL: made fresh in front of me. The rice on the roll was good. And the ginger on the side was the best!\n\nKAKUNI BAO: the meat was very soft, you dont have to chew it. The flavor has perfect seasoning. The bao was soft and new.\n\nPrice rating: 8/10 price range. $23 for tonkatsu and salmon avocado roll plus $4 for one piece of kakuni bao\n\nI will definitely come back here because everything was good!

            "text": "Momosan never disappoints me. Spicy Tonkotsu paired with Curry Rice is my go-to for their lunch special. The Spicy Tonkotsu has the right amount of heat and the broth is perfectly cooked. Paired it with their generous portion of Curry Rice and that is indeed value for money. Plus there is no other Chicken Kara-age that can be comparable to Momosan’s. My list of fav dishes at Momosan is endless: brussel sprouts, kakuni bun, gyoza and more. Will def return with friends and family."

The broth was some of the best I’ve ever had, rich and creamy  and the noodles were perfectly cooked. It was followed by Curry Don, a simple dish of melt in your mouth pork, and curry sauce over rice. A very satisfying meal. The service couldn’t have been better. The room was understated and lovely."

Had to wait about 25 minutes which wasn't too bad and upon being seated it was very clear this was a family-friendly place. The one thing I noticed is that the music was a teensy bit loud but other than that the place felt cozy and roomy! We split a few apps - the chicken karaage, the brussel sprouts, and the pork gyoza which were all delicious! The ramen was also great - I went with the chicken katsu curry special which was perfect though I will say the base was a little oily for my liking. The chicken cutlets were well-seasoned and well-breaded! All in all, a great meal with friends."

Plus if you sit at the bar, Johan, provides the most excellent service.  Oh those yummy ribs are superb!  Jenny is awesome too, if you’re dining at night.  She’s the friendly face who’s great at her job.  Both Johan and Jenny are the best!"
