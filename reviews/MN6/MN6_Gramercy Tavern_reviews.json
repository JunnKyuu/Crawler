The food was amazing, the prices were very reasonable for what we got, and the team there is amazing. Mary Beth was the main one helping us out and she was incredible! One of the best hospitality professionals I have ever interacted with. She made the meal so fun and took such great care of us.\n\nI wish I could more adequately describe how amazing this place is but you need to go there. You won’t regret it!"

The staff went all out with amazing costumes, spooky-fun decor, and even a trick-or-treat spread. The mini cupcakes were perfect! A+ vibes, incredible food, and the kind of service that makes you want to come back again and again. Highly recommend!"

The space is beautiful—big but warm, with a great vibe that makes it feel both lively and welcoming. Service throughout was friendly, personable, and exactly what you’d expect from a restaurant of this caliber. I went with the tasting menu, which was excellent and very seasonal. Each course came with two options, and there were some tough choices to make. The meal started strong with an amuse-bouche of oysters that were outstanding and set high expectations for the rest of the night. The beets I had as a starter were delicious and perfectly in season, and the hay-smoked gnocchi was another standout—rich, earthy, and full of flavor. The lamb was also excellent, though my portion had a bit more bone than I would’ve liked. Dessert brought things full circle with a hazelnut tart in a Concord grape sauce that was both seasonal and beautifully balanced. Overall, an outstanding dinner and a place I’d happily return to!"

Then a complimentary glass of champagne. We then discussed wine with the Sommelier Alvaro Mondaca. He was very knowledgeable  and gracious. The tasting menu was delicious and each course was interesting with complex blends of flavors.\nThe service was outstanding and on point. During our meal we recalled a meal we had a long time ago and couldn't remember what wine we had. We asked Alvaro by describing the food and where the wine might have come from. He returned a couple of minutes later with the right answer! He was brilliant and to top it off as we completed our meal he presented us with a small tasting of the wine!! Very classy. All in all Gramercy Tavern and the food and service made for a great birthday celebration! Thank you all."

Nice spot, busy location!\n\nI really wanted to LOVE the food - but it was average at the tavern on a Thursday afternoon in October.\n\nThe focaccia with summer squash was beautiful to look at, flavor was average - lacked salt. Flavor was bland.\n\nWe ordered the oysters - good flavor profile, but lacking salt + acid.\n\nI tried the infamous burger - it was lacking on \"char\" (the maillard effect) and salt. It was a good, average burger. The chips that came with it were tasty.\n\nMy partner got the Brick Pressed Chicken and it was not crispy, the flavors were mediocre."

The atmosphere felt warm, cozy, and perfectly balanced between casual and elegant. Their wine list is outstanding—one of the most diverse and carefully curated we’ve seen in a while. We ordered a Barolo, and it completely blew us away with its depth and richness. The food was equally fantastic: I had the meatballs, and my wife had the chicken—both dishes were perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Everything tasted fresh, seasonal, and thoughtfully prepared. The service was professional yet friendly, adding to the relaxed, authentic vibe of the place. The interior design felt timeless and intimate, like a hidden gem in the middle of the city. It’s the kind of restaurant where you instantly feel at home but still treated to something special. We’ll definitely be going back soon—Gramercy Tavern truly lives up to its reputation."

The space is beautiful - elegant but inviting - with thoughtful details that make it feel both special and comfortable. The service was flawless: warm, attentive, and professional without ever feeling stiff. Our server was genuinely kind and guided us through the menu with such knowledge and care. The food was outstanding. Every dish was perfectly balanced, beautifully presented, and full of flavour - refined but never pretentious. Standouts for us were the tomato salad, beef carpaccio, and the pork shoulder, but honestly, everything we tried was exceptional. The wine pairings were thoughtful and elevated the meal even more. What really stood out was the hospitality. We were celebrating a special occasion and were surprised with a lovely glass of champagne, which made the evening feel even more memorable. Little touches like that show why this restaurant has such a legendary reputation. Gramercy Tavern deserves every accolade it has received. It’s a perfect choice for a celebration or any time you want to enjoy exquisite food, beautiful ambiance, and truly world-class service."

The cocktails were a fantastic start—absolutely 5 out of 5. The staff was warm and attentive, and the atmosphere was lively and welcoming.\n\nThe flatbread was excellent, one of the highlights of the meal. But overall, I was hoping for a bit more from the rest of the food. We tried the burger, pork shoulder, swordfish, tomato salad, and liver mousse. While some dishes were fine, the burger and pork shoulder in particular were disappointing and just didn’t hit the mark. The salad and mousse also felt a little ordinary.\n\nFor a place with such a strong reputation—and at this price point—I expected the dishes to shine more. Still, the service and vibe were wonderful, which made the experience enjoyable overall.\n\nIf I had to rate it: 5 stars for service and ambiance, but about 3 stars for the food, so overall a solid 3 stars."

I was very excited to come here to try the restaurant week menu. I came for a celebration, which everyone in the staff wished me well so I appreciated that. I really liked the host, but I felt like my waitress wasn’t as attentive in the beginning of my meal. There were several times I needed something but she wasn’t around. Towards the end she was better at checking up. I also read other reviews and realized they did not give me things like the crudité or the red pepper dipping sauce for the bread. I got the restaurant week three course menu. I loved the beef carpaccio. The pork cutlet wasn’t really that memorable so I wouldn’t go for it. And I asked the waitress for her recommendation for dessert and got the apricot tart which I definitely regret because I did not care for how tart/sour it was. So basically only one of the three courses I really enjoyed. I’m not sure I would go back, especially knowing they didn’t even give me the full experience by not offering me the same things they offered others in these reviews."

The atmosphere was filled with beautiful aromas of perfection being prepared in the kitchen!!! My husband ordered a beautiful pasta dish and I ordered the famous cheeseburger!! Both dishes were delicious!!! We each paired our meal with a glass of wine of which was recommended by our server."

The biscuits were by far my favorite and a must order. For mains, we shared the tavern burger which was very soft and the aioli it came with was delicious. The pork shoulder on the other hand was unflavored but tender, and I would not recommend it. The desserts were great; we got the chocolate pudding cake which was my favorite, ricotta fritters, and basil olive oil cake."

The restaurant was so beautiful inside with all the plants, flowers, rustic decor, huge bar, really created a wonderful tavern vibe.\n\nWe started our meal with soft and fluffy bacon cheddar biscuits. There were 4 of them in the plate. Having only one of those didn’t seem enough. For entree I had the Tavern burger. It was made with a thick paddy that had delicious flavor topped with melted cheese. The aioli sauce on the side was so good that it enhanced the taste of the burger. My coworkers loved their pressed chicken and meal ball dishes as well.\n\nAt the end, we ordered a bunch desserts including lemon cake, passion fruit sundae and chocolate cookie. Sundae was my favorite. It was so delicious, incredible flavor of passion fruit and vanilla ice cream. The cookie was little too sweet for me. But the lemon cake was pure quality.\n\nOur server Jasmine was amazing. Did an awesome job throughout the lunch. Rest of the staff were also equally pro, filling water, cleaning plates, folding napkins, they were on top of it all. Everyone was super attentive and fully dedicated to their job. At the end they also brought us a small cake for our office celebration. So kind and thoughtful gesture from them. Overall we had a great team lunch. I was so pleased to see Gramercy delivered above and beyond my expectations."

I was impressed by the décor and atmosphere. I highly recommend the seasonal menu. The service was excellent, and our chef, Michael, did a great job explaining the food when he came over. If you're having dinner with someone, I suggest ordering both options for each course and sharing them. Everything was delicious in my experience. It is a fixed-price experience, and you can pair it with wine if you wish. Finally, it was fairly easy to make a reservation. If you have the opportunity, you should definitely check it out!"

We went for 3-course summer restaurant week menu and the food was overall good but not very consistent in terms of tastiness. The highlights were the pre-meal sweet potato bread with red pepper dip, the sweet corn lumache (appetizer) and golden tilefish (main). The lowlights were the snowdance farm chicken (main) and peach tart (dessert) — the chicken didn’t feel like one a Michelin one star restaurant would offer; it’s bit dry and feels like something an ordinary person could make at home, and the peach tart wasn’t a cake as we imagined but instead a cooked peach that tasted weird."

            "text": "We visited during Gramercy Tavern during Restaurant Week, which made it a more approachable way to try the menu, but I’m not sure I’d recommend it outside of that promotion, especially if you’re ordering à la carte.\n\nThe food was solid and well-executed, but nothing really wowed. It felt like a very safe, polished version of seasonal American cuisine — satisfying, but not particularly memorable. That said, the setting does elevate the overall experience. The restaurant is split into two spaces: the more formal dining room, which serves a tasting menu, and the bar room, where you can order à la carte in a more relaxed but still elegant environment.\n\nService was gracious and professional, but very slow. We ended up waiting quite a bit between each course — nearly 1.5 hours for just three dishes, which felt unnecessarily drawn out, especially for a lunch seating.\n\nAll in all, Gramercy Tavern is worth a visit for the atmosphere alone, and it’s a solid choice during Restaurant Week. Just temper your expectations a bit when it comes to pacing and flavor fireworks."

The bread which came along with the carpaccio was soo good. For mains I tried the charred Broccoli and shared the pasta with a friend. The broccoli was yum and the flavourful though the pasta was a little too tart.\n\nService : Quite sweet and knowledgeable staff!

From the moment we arrived, the staff’s warmth, kindness, and attentiveness made us feel genuinely welcomed and cared for. Every dish was full of flavor, with beautifully handcrafted sauces that tied everything together. The Citrus-Cured Char, Sweet Pea Agnolotti, Golden Tilefish, Lamb, and Sweet Potato Bread were all fantastic.\nWhat truly stood out was the dessert: The Strawberry Sorbet with Ginger Foam Ice Cream was incredibly creative and refreshing. The Strawberry Pistachio Cheesecake, Caramelized Banana Tart, and mini cream-filled donuts had smooth, creamy fillings and were absolutely divine.\nThis evening wasn’t just a dinner—it was a celebration of love, friendship, and new beginnings. My dear friends celebrated my birthday and a new chapter for my husband and me. To experience all of that in such a beautiful setting made the night truly unforgettable.🧡\nAs we left, we were even given chocolate chip cookies and coffee cake—a thoughtful touch that stayed with us.\nWithout a doubt, Gramercy Tavern will remain my favorite restaurant in NYC—a place where every meal feels like a gift.👍😊"

Overall really enjoyed myself, and left stuffed / satiated, but would probably go elsewhere next time given the price point.

Goat cheese went well with the jam and crackers, and the second cheese tasted the best individually (you know we tried everything Ratatouille style 👨🏾‍🍳)\n\nSeasonal Menu:\n- Crudité: Nice palette cleanser / refresher\n- Fluke: Really fresh and flavorful, solid start\n- Gnocchi: Great sauce and bites, was a fantastic portion\n- Sweet Pea Agnolotti (v): My sis got this and it was crazyyyy\n- Sweet Potato Roll: Really good! Lighter and fluffier than regular dinner rolls, enjoyed!\n- Golden Tilefish: Did not like this, fish and shrimp were really bland and fishy-tasting for me\n- Elysian Field Lamb: So good! Great recovery from prior course, and honestly by this point, I was about to explode\n- Carolina Gold Rice (v): My sis loved this\n- Apricot Tart: way way way too sour, the apricot was straight up inedible lol\n- Chocolate Meringue Pie: def better than apricot tart, but again, berries were WAY too sour"

As it was my buddy and me, we ended up with almost every dish.\n\nThe cheese platter is a must-get, the shaved cheese was really good as was the meat. I also really like the cinnamon cookie.\n\nThe citrus cured char had great pop from the lemon and the roe, and a pea sauce that was tasty.\n\nThe sweet potato was really boring, nothing remotely special.\n\nThe dumplings were really bland, with chewy dough and meat on the inside that was missing seasoning. Same for the broth.\n\nThe agnolotti was nice but it was the same pea sauce on the citrus cured char so that was a downer.\n\nThe tilefish and red shrimp were really good, with a broth/sauce that was seafoody and spiced really well, fantastic dish.\n\nThe roasted asparagus was really boring and had the same pea sauce a third time. The pave was respectable but did fall apart a little more easily than expected.\n\nThe lamb was very good, high quality and rendered well.\n\nThe sirloin was one of the worst dishes -- along with the dumplings -- due to the same boredom. The meat wasn't really tasty or meaty, and I like rare steak. Avoid.\n\nNeither dessert was worth mentioning, just a bit of sugar. Oh actually the sorbet on the cheesecake was nice, but the rest I wouldn't order.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend, this was a really disappointing meal and especially for a Friday night. I now need to go re-test the bar to see if the burger is still good."

Well tourists are still coming. Why bother? I felt like walking into a Texas ranch when I saw the silk flowers, oversized furniture and exposed beams on the ceiling. Ok so I thought this would be a hearty American meal with good portions. No! It’s actually a French tasting menu with five courses at $175. Let’s just say the level of refinement and sophistication is not there. The only thing French about it is the portion: tiny little serving built up on coarse rustic plates. Odd. Overpriced. Primitive. Service was the only thing that was memorable. For food, you have plenty of options in the big Apple!"
