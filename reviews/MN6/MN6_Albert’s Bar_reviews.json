            "text": "Sad and pathetic how mediocre NY restaurants think they’re better than they actually are. Albert’s is one of those. Loud, pretentious midtown bros who you couldn’t tell one from the other loudly crowded the place.\n\nThat wasn’t even the worst of it. The food quality has greatly diminished too: the rotten and stinky beer, the $25 burger that couldn’t compete with a Burger King Whopper, and the overpriced salad with chicken that tasted worse than deli chicken. Even worse? I hate when servers hover behind you to see how much tip you leave on that portable card reader. Our server, Lydia, did just that. When she saw we barely left any tip, she shook her head, scoffed, and immediately asked, what could we have done better? When I told her, she fired back a defense for each one. Looking for basic American fare and decent cocktails? Go to The Smith, just a few blocks north, if you’re already in midtown."

The seating inside includes some bar seating and booths. There is also outdoor seating as well which some patrons enjoyed but it was too hot for us.\n\nWe got seated right away at a booth. We were initially here for just the drinks but got peckish and so ended up ordering some food.\n\nDrinks:\n- Barrel Aged Martinez: SO GOOD. We got it twice! It's a bit alcohol forward but the smokiness balances it great. I also thought it had a great caramel after taste\n- Albert's Gibson: Loved the refreshing Yuzu in this\n- Yellowstone Collins: Super duper refreshing as well\n\nFood:\n- Shoe string fries: Nothing to complain about fries.\n- Albert's Burger: Great burger!\n- Mac n Cheese: Quite a good serving for the price! also delicious\n- Bonus - house made hot sauce: I asked for hot sauce and they gave me this and I thought it was AWESOME.\n\nThe service was GREAT. Super friendly staff and super nice. Explained some things about the menu to us as well.\n\nI would definitely visit again! Perhaps with a larger group as well"

Given its ingredients, I was surprised I did not like it. I don’t know how to describe its flavor other than “not tasty.” I could not finish it.\n\nThe woman I went with had the broccoli sandwich and Curious George. Both of these were better than what I ordered, but she did not finish the sandwich and was still hungry after the meal. I did not enjoy the sips I had of her cocktail either.\n\nA waste of 50 bucks."

For food, we ordered the Forbidden Rice Arancini and Shishito Peppers, which were both fine—nothing to write home about. The drinks are obviously the star of the show.

We even got to meet the owner for a chit chat as well.\nNonetheless, if you are in NYC, go and visit Albert’s you will not be disappointed - very nice upscale bar/restaurant with great prices!
