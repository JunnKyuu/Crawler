            "text": "I visited Banter around 8 am with a friend. The coffee was amazing, really delicious, smooth, and fragrant. However, the muffin I ordered was quite hard and didn’t seem fresh, which was surprising that early in the morning when pastries are usually at their best. It honestly felt like it might have been from the previous day.\nI mentioned it to the staff hoping they might offer a small discount or replace it, but unfortunately, I still paid full price.\nThat said, the waitress was kind and attentive, and everything else about the visit was great. I’m keeping my 5 stars because the coffee alone was exceptional and the overall vibe of the place was lovely."

            "text": "The food is the best part of this and in my opinion just worth grabbing a few bites of. We got a Banter bowl and a chicken Parma.\n\nThe banter bowl literally looked like a cornucopia - and everything was fresh and well prepared. It was so SO good that it literally made us decide that we need to come back.\n\nThe chicken Parma was delicious, with the ham layered on it - it’s great for a meal. It comes on a bed of seasoned fries that were also done really well.\n\nPaired with decently priced beer at $6 on the low end this place is really a great value for what you pay."

There was a miso lemon glaze on them that made the peppers an unami bomb! This aside, their lemon curd pavlova and nutella  chocolate bars were brilliant!"

The atmosphere was relaxed and inviting—ideal for catching up and having meaningful conversations. There were plenty of vegetarian options, and the snack plates were generous and easy to share. A standout feature was the happy hour, which included the full wine menu—featuring some lovely Australian selections. Staff here was very welcoming and friendly. I’d absolutely recommend this place for a group get-together, whether it’s a casual meet-up or a small academic reunion."

Our drinks and appetizers arrived in a reasonable amount of time, though our entrees took over 35 minutes to arrive after we finished eating the apps. Our waitress was kind and acknowledged our long wait time and we tipped appropriately as we assumed it was out of her control. Very disappointing experience and unfortunately I would not recommend."

Besides the clean food, this culture is known for a laid-back vibe and warm hospitality. The food was just OK, but the vibe was very off-putting. The waiter hounded us to order before we even sat down properly or had a drink. The drinks arrived with the food. And my wine, which I was planning to have with the meal, was forgotten all together (therefore cancelled). The barista/bartender was slowly dolling out fancy coffees while clearly ignoring orders that actually cost/make money. Two waiters were interchangeable, the gentlemen barely said a word and seemed rushed and confused, the lady was detached and aloof. Drinks and food got dropped off at the table with no commentary or eye contact. The place should be a takeout restaurant with an option to stay for coffee, maybe. This is NOT a representative of Australian culture or cuisine. A true Aussie would've been embarrassed. I know I was... Even the name is comical. BANTER with zero conversation or hospitality? More like a costlier OUTBACK IN&OUT."

Got the Banter Big Breakfast and honestly didn’t expect much but every component of the dish worked well together. Ordered their Red Radiance juice as well and it was perfect. A friend got their Mushroom Toast but noted that the whipped garlic feta may be a tad bit too overpowering for some. Overall a great place for brunch that actually tastes good!"

While I really enjoy the food, I find it extremely frustrating and rude that the waitstaff remove my plate before I even finish eating—sometimes within just 20 minutes of sitting down! Even when I am still slowly eating my fries, they take my food away without asking, and then immediately bring the check without me requesting it. This has happened to me multiple times (3-4 times), and I felt the need to bring it to your attention.\n\nPlease allow your customers to enjoy their meals at their own pace and be more considerate. No one should feel like they are being rushed out. Some customers may want to relax, have coffee or dessert, or simply take their time before receiving the check. I hope this issue is addressed, as it seriously affects the dining experience.\n\nThank you."

I imagine it would be quite a nice brunch spot.\n\nThe avocado toast was ok. It was a bit too simple, and it was on sourdough bread, which in my opinion is not the right fit for avocado toasts. Anyway I think it's only a 3 ⭐. Though I can see myself visiting again to try a different dish."

Chicken pesto panini sandwich was also very delicious.\n\nFor weekends, would recommend making a reservation or coming early. Lines can be around 40 mins long\n\nDinner- got the Wednesday dinner deal for $22 -chicken parm and a pint of any draft beer. Delicious. Comes with a salad (kale and broccoli) and fries. Can be very loud. There was a table of 8 kids sitting next to us and the restaurant is small."

He informed our waitress that he has a severe nut allergy and to please make a note to the chef in case of cross-contamination. The waitress said ok but barely acknowledged it. Towards the end of our meal, my boyfriend started to have a small allergic reaction. We asked for the check and informed the waitress about the reaction and she pretty much only said something along the lines of “oh I don’t see how that happened”. We paid in full, left, and had to monitor him for the next three hours to make sure the reaction did not worsen as he could go into anaphylactic shock. Very careless and dismissive service."

The menu didn't seem too extraordinary for a brunch cafe and I knew my sister and friend weren't very hungry. However, once we stepped inside, the interior was welcoming and we were pleasantly surprised by the food we ordered. All of them were a hit! We got the mushroom tagliatelle, falafel bowl, spicy fries, and brussel sprouts. They were a 9/10 overall and I would especially recommend the pasta and brussel sprouts. Props to the portion sizes as well-2 entrees and 2 sides let us eat to our heart's content"

While the menu is simple with the basics (and only sourdough as your choice for bread), it makes it easy to order and even easier to add options.\n\nThe banquette seating in the corner was comfortable with a great view of the whole space. They opened at 8 am, and it was pretty quiet until about 9:15 when a line started to form at the host station.\n\nNow the food: 2 of us had scrambled eggs, but I had the extra ingredients in the \"Golden Folded Eggs\" option. The mushrooms and eggs were the stars of the show and the supporting cast of bacon 🥓 avocado 🥑 & sourdough bread 🍞 made it perfect. It also came with a small \"green salad\" (which turned out to be kale). 🥗\n\nThe espresso ☕️ was good and strong, and they do have Saratoga sparkling water 💧 by the bottle.\n\nOur server/host James was a gem and didn't skip a beat. Food was delicious, served hot and accurately. Will definitely be back. #LocalGem #GoodEats #theresthatfoodie"

See got there at 6pm and they still had Happy Hour not only on drinks but burgers too! All burgers are half off on Monday during Happy Hour! How cool!? Ali was amazing! Very attentive, sweet, knowledgeable of the whole menu. Gave us recommendations that were up to par with our expectations. They were packed to the brim that night and since they just opened that location, the kitchen did their best to fill orders as fast as they could. Nonetheless, the food was exceptional! Oh and I thought the fact that they have filtered water and not tap was next level!  Highly recommend the falafel bowl, sausage and peppers roll, Fried Chicken Sandwich and the Banter Burger. We tried their Lemon Curd Pavlova but unfortunately it was a bit stale for our liking. Flavor profile was good though. Definitely will be going back to try the Curried Butternut Squash Soup and their Banana Bread and some more of that falafel bowl. Probably the most delicious falafel I ever had! See you soon Ali!"
