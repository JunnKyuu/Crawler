            "text": "Best for: groups, special dinners, food lovers who appreciate presentation and interesting Chinese/Asian fusion dishes.\n\nWhat to try: Definitely the Peking duck. If you have room, the lamb skewers and beef rib/crust dishes get strong mentions.\n\nTips: Go early or make a reservation to avoid long waits. Don’t expect a luxe ambiance — the focus is more on the food than the interior.\n\nExpectations: You’ll likely get excellent food for the price, but it’s not fine-dining luxury nor low-cost casual; expect a mid-to-upper price range in Manhattan."

I've eaten duck in Alexandria, San Francisco,  and even Beijing, and never found it prepared as perfectly as it is here.\n\nPaper-thin pancakes, hoisin, green onion,  and, of course, that beautiful duck, with crispy skin, rich fat, and perfectly roasted meat. I'm glad I didn't find this place earlier in my visit, or I just would have come back here every night.\n\nThe service is quick and attentive. The dining room is clean, but the decor is somehow both sterile and gaudy.  Still, the food more than makes up for any other shortcomings."

They couldn’t see right away, but it was a short 10 minute wait the staff is very attentive very on top of it.\n\nWe weren’t hungry, so we just ordered only the Peking Duk however everything looked so good. I want to order so much more but trying to eat later these days.\n\nWe also ordered a side of duck soup, which was only two dollars\n\nEverything hit all the right spots the soup and the pecking duck were absolutely perfect. I loved everything so much that will go back and I wanna go back and try other things and maybe even order more duck. I can’t express how happy I am but it’s on my overall happiness listso five stars all the way go try this place out."

Saying the dishes taste \"just like in China\" doesn’t do them justice—Chef Huang has gone beyond what’s considered authentic and instead focused on unlocking the full potential of each ingredient’s natural flavor.\nWhen I saw the accolades at the entrance—\"Restaurant of the Year\" and \"Chef of the Year\" by a major Chinese culinary media—I was not surprised. In fact, I believe Chef Huang’s restaurant easily rivals, if not surpasses, several Chinese restaurants recently featured in the New York Times’ Top 100 or other English-language food media. In terms of flavor, craftsmanship, and overall experience, this place is in a league of its own."

We pre-ordered the crab (along with the lobster and fish) a day ahead. The day of, we wanted the crab scallion ginger style but the waiter came back after we ordered and was like the chef said no--we had to get it either HK style or hot spicy. We found that a little weird, but sure, we got it HK style instead. When the crab came, it was obvious why. The crab was not fresh. The meat was extremely mushy and flavorless. For something that cost over $80 and that we pre-ordered, there was really no excuse for that. (Also, I would not recommend their version of HK style; scallion ginger was a lot better)."

I am a long term COVID patient. Since the first round, I had lost both smell and taste. Fast forward six years, I regained about 75% smell and 60% taste. My first bite of Spring Roll was an experience I’ve not had in SIX years! I actually tasted individual ingredients!!! This happened for EVERY bite of food I had. I was embarrassing myself because I truly thought I would never again taste food so fully again, and I could not contain my amazement. What is somewhat unbelievable is that it is lasting as the next evening I went out and ordered scallops at a French restaurant. I literally smelled them as they came out of the kitchen, and I was far from the kitchen and could not see them bringing things out. If my travels take me anywhere near Manhattan, I will ALWAYS stop there for a meal. THANK YOU, Chef Huang’s."

We got to the restaurant around 8, there is street parking to be found in the area after 7pm. It was my first time here…the restaurant is cute but tiny…7 tables in total and one additional table in a private room..expect a lengthy wait…it was a bit disappointing that even with the reservations we actually didn’t get our table until 9, which means we were sitting around waiting for an hour, not ideal especially with little ones! The staff did their best to accommodate, and put our order in while we were waiting so that our food arrived shortly after we sat down, which was amazing given that we were starving by then. We got the table in the back in the private room and it’s a great place for a celebration. The food was worth the wait!! The duck was amazing, definitely the highlight here…crispy skin, tender meat…really good flavor! My son loved the soup dumplings…The scallion pancake was less oily than what I am used to but nothing special. Would recommend the mashed garlic cucumber as an accompaniment: so yum, we should have ordered two!! The beef ribs with crispy crust were good but heavy…really tasty with the pineapple on the side. Dessert was delicious too and really fun for the kids we had the chocolate ice cream shaped as different animals. My 9 year old proclaimed this was the best meal she’s ever had and she loves to eat out so that says a lot! Not the best meal I’ve ever had but I would definitely be back for their duck…wouldn’t bother making reservations next time and would just walk in expecting a long wait. Overall great dinner experience, worth the wait!"

As someone from Beijing, I think the Peking duck here is the closest to the ones I've had in Beijing. 🦆 I've tried several places in New York and the Bay Area, but nothing compares to the quality here.\n\nThe duck is incredibly juicy and crispy, with perfectly caramelized skin that shatters with each bite, revealing tender and savory meat underneath. The flavor and texture are so rich and satisfying. Each bite melts in your mouth 😋\n\nThe duck is served with delicate pancakes, fresh scallions, and a tangy-sweet hoisin sauce. The balance of crispy skin, succulent meat, and vibrant condiments creates a symphony of flavors that is both satisfying and addictive. 🥢✨\n\nWhether you're a Peking duck aficionado or simply love great food, Chef Huang's is a must-visit spot for Peking duck. Savor each moment of a beautifully crafted meal that leaves a lasting impression. 🍽️"

My only wish is that they give more of the cucumbers and scallions to add into the wrap, but no big deal. The beef ribs in crispy pancakes were AMAZING. The beef ribs were so tender and highly suggest that as a possible starter. Highly recommend the Peking duck, soup dumplings, chef’s special beef ribs with crispy pancake and lamb skewers, and house special noodles. They also give a complimentary soup when you order the Peking duck. Hopefully I’ll be back! I also recommend making a reservation because it does get busy."

Oh, and the dog shaped ice cream freaked all of us out. It was too realistic when we cut the head off with our spoons.\n\nThe service was fine and quick. The awkward part was 6 of us at a table ordering a lot of food only to have no room for the plates. Example: they brought out a big plate for rice when it could’ve been a bowl. The Peking duck was brought out on a large display case when it needed to be a regular plate.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the food was very good except the duck - not worth the $80 - far too fatty. All other good was good! The display of food on the table was awkward and too much for show. It needs to be simplified.\n\n4.1/5"

We ordered the half peking duck, lamb kebabs and vegetable fried noodles. Honestly, this might've been one of the best peking ducks I've had. The duck was flavorful and the meat was juicy. The wrappers were as thin as crepes and for just half a duck, they gave more than enough for 2 people to share. I think I'm a fan of kebabs as the lamb kebabs here were tender and well seasoned. It came as 5 skewers over a small stone grill with 3 pieces on each stick. The vegetable fried noodles were a pretty big portion as well, next time I think I'll try the meat versions of this dish as it felt like something was misssing from the flavor profile...seafood or scallops would've been a great addition.\n\nThe server was quietly attentive in refilling our water glasses through out our meal.\n\nThe decor here doesn't really match what's on the menu. It gives off a French bakery vibe, both the exterior and interior.\n\nRestrooms are downstairs and have the decor of a flower garden."

Will definitely return just for that and the duck broth that came with it.\n\nBut just for fun I ordered the animal shaped chocolate ice cream.\n\n…\n\nDon’t order the animal shaped chocolate ice cream. It tastes like (and has the consistency of) refrigerated rubber that was in the same room as a piece of chocolate\n\nPS you’re a psychopath if you eat the head first"

            "text": "A new Chinese restaurant. They don't serve traditional Chinese or American style Chinese food. Instead, their dishes are more of a fusion. Very creative and tastes good.\n\nRecommend: wine marinated raw crab, Peking duck, braised beef with crispy pancake, and lamb kabob. I also recommend ribeye with crispy pancake - it's like a rib style of beef Wellington.\n\nReservations not needed for weekday dinner but wait can be around 15 min. Small dining area. Service can definitely improve."

It is low key and no thrills (but with nice ambiance), far from tourist traps of Chinatown,but the food + hospitality are beyond wonderful. Also highly instagrammable foaming sanitizer thing! Must try their Peking duck, lamb skewers, chiken pot pie, fried lobster, coffee ice cream dessert (and so much more, I just don't remember dishes names).\nThe back room is perfect for a 10-15  people party."

Together with the pancake, scallion whites, and the sauce, everything just melted in my mouth. I can’t wait to go back again!\n\nDisclaimer: some of the dish can be a tad too salty/flavorful but as long as you order the duck you will be left satisfied."

They’re pancakes are thin and stretchy, and the scallions are razor thin. It’s high class. To top it off, the people who run this place are SO nice. Always greet me with a smile, and happy to squeeze we in even when they’re really busy.\n\nI’m moving to another neighborhood soon, but will come back for this duck. It’s just so good!"

            "text": "I saw the restaurant had a $10 lunch special with 3 meats(braised beef with potatoes, chicken broccoli and mapo tofu) served with white rice and duck soup. There were no menus at the time and the QR code outside just lead to their website that had a few random pictures of food and the chef. The kitchen is downstairs out of view. While making my order they informed me that they ran out of everything except the braised beef with potatoes so they gave me that with the soup but promised it’d be extra meat. Eating this was a disappointment. The rice tasted exactly like when I add too much water to my rice cooker, the beef was bland and the soup only vaguely tasted like duck. The potatoes were probably the best part about this dish. I had a hard time finishing this meal, it was mostly rice with 2 spoons of beef. Certainly don’t see any reason to ever go back here."
