Also they incentivize $5 discounts for giving a review on google maps, which is probably part of why they have such high ratings. Be warned. Aesthetics and food taste is still good though, just menu prices for specialty dishes are significantly higher than anything I've seen in the dozens of thai places I've been in Manhattan. So my family ordered the simpler dishes only"

I spoke to a woman who assured me my food will be ready in 10 minutes and it’ll cost $22 and change. When my coworker arrived, a man said the order was never placed and that was a lie. My coworker said he saw a woman in the kitchen cooking and the perception was she was the woman who took my order but acted as if she never got it when the fact was she didn’t want to admit that she forgot to submit my order. This was very disappointing, unprofessional and negligent on their behalf especially since competition is high in Manhattan and I can go to one of the other Thai restaurants within a 3 block radius. Their food is delicious but what they did to me and my coworker was lousy."

            "text": "TLDR: The price is worth it, food is plated wonderfully, is delicious, the small restaurants aesthetic is wonderful, and the customer service experience is amazing (Ohm was a great help).\n\nI’ll be the first to say that this restaurant is on the pricier end. Nothing too undoable, but notably pricier than other Thai restaurants in the immediate area. However, its price is wholly reflective of the quality of service, food served, and the presentation of the food. Ohm, the server who took my order, was super friendly, and had great recommendations. He was also very understanding when I messed up my order the first time, and helped me resolve it with no qualms. So not only was the food great, but the customer service was excellent.\n\nI ordered their lunch special online to go, which included Basil Fried Rice, Fries, Spring Rolls, and a drink, along with their Mango Sticky Rice and a Thai Tea to eat there. The flavor of the Basil Fried Rice was great, the heat wasn’t overpowering the other flavors (a pet peeve of mine), the texture of the rice was great, and it was a good, classic dish overall. My friend (who the Lunch Special was actually for, I just stole some), who is notoriously picky, enjoyed it tons.\n\nThe real show stopper for me was their Mango Sticky Rice (which was actually ordered for me). The dessert is coming back in season, and they’re advertising it rightfully so. The homemade Coconut Ice cream is comes with is downright delicious. I wish I could emphasize that more. It was creamy, decadent, and indulgent. Note that this is coming from someone who was actually initially skeptical since I’m not a big fan of Coconut Ice Cream (Ohm assured me it was delicious, and checked in with me afterwards. He was obviously right). The rest of the dish was wonderfully balanced. The Coconut Cream wasn’t too sweet, the salt was well balanced, the rice was warm and just the right texture, and on top of all of this, it was plated beautifully. Not deserving of its own paragraph, but still delicious was the Thai Tea— not too sweet which is exactly how I like it.\n\nI will be raving about this restaurant for a long while and recommending it to all my friends."

They were super friendly and really attentive without being over the top. The salmon green curry was a standout, and we ended the night with mango sticky rice that was spot on. The live music gave the place such a good vibe; honestly, it felt like being back home. It's definitely a spot I’d come back to and recommend to friends."

Despite its very small space, this restaurant packs a punch with some of the BEST THAI FOOD we’ve ever had—EVER!\n\nFrom the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted by the warm and welcoming staff who made us feel right at home. Their friendly demeanor and attentiveness added to the charm of this cozy spot, making the atmosphere inviting and enjoyable.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the food. Our dinner was nothing short of spectacular.  We ordered the basil fried rice, which was bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. The fragrant basil and fresh ingredients made it an absolute delight!\n\nWe also ordered in the Frenched Lamb Chop Nam Jim Jaew, and it was a showstopper. The lamb was tender and juicy, beautifully seasoned. Each bite was packed with flavor, making it one of the highlights of our meal.\n\nFinally, the star of our dinner was the Crispy Duck Tamarind with jasmine rice. The duck was perfectly crispy on the outside, succulent on the inside, and the tamarind sauce added a unique and delicious twist. It was a dish that truly showcased the culinary prowess of the kitchen.\n\nOverall, our experience at Thai Food Near Me was phenomenal!!! While the space may be small, the quality of the food and the warmth of the staff more than make up for it. If you’re in the Murray Hill area, do yourself a favor and stop by—you won’t regret it!"

They brought me a little pitcher with water so I can pour some into a little golden leaf with a magic towel to wash my hands. The quality of the food, the service, the modern, chic decor and attention to details are all AMAZING! I went there expecting another simple Thai noodle lunch but they hit it out of the park!"

Tonight I had a Crispy Fish (rainbow trout) special. It was a massive portion, super fresh and truly, as promised, crispy, with a spicy mango and cashew salad. Heavenly! My companions had massaman curry, pad Thai, and pork belly, all spectacular.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the meal was that we needed to switch tables to accommodate one member of our party, and they did it with grace and smiles, though it was doubtless a colossal PITA for them. I thank them and want to promote this lovely restaurant for their thoughtfulness and terrific food and service."

It is, I'm sure, the purest source of authentic Thai river prawns-almost like dining in Thailand. Crispy pork, papaya salad, and pad Thai are some extra mouthwatering options. 😋 The owner and all staff members are extremely welcoming, 🫶🏻 and the service is fantastic. The food is completed on time. I absolutely adore it and consider it one of the best Thai restaurant in Manhattan!"
