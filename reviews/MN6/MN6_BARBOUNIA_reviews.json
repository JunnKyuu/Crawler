            "text": "Really enjoyed my visit to Barbounia! The ambiance was great, lively, but still comfortable. I got there a bit early and sat at the bar while waiting for the rest of my party. Even though I didn’t stay long, the bartender (didn’t catch his name) was super attentive and friendly, which started the night off right.\n\nWe didn’t realize our reservation landed during the switch between lunch and dinner service, so we had to wait until 5 p.m. to order from the dinner menu. It would’ve been nice to know that when booking, but not a huge deal.\n\nOnce seated, a waiter (who we actually never saw again) took our mezze order. We got the spicy feta, fire-roasted eggplant, pickles & olives, and taboon flatbread and WOW, every single one was amazing. Super flavorful and fresh. Couldn’t even pick a favorite!\n\nWe also ordered the grilled Portuguese octopus, which was perfectly cooked, tender, soft, and easy to cut. Didn’t even need a knife.\n\nFor mains, we went with the lamb kofta kebab terracotta and the slow-cooked short ribs. The kofta was okay but nothing special (maybe a bit overhyped on social media). The short ribs, though, were simply incredible rich, beefy, and tender. My only complaint is that they were a bit too salty, and the couscous on the side was pretty dry.\n\nOverall, really nice experience. The vibe was great. I’d definitely come back, maybe next time just for drinks and mezze at the bar!"

They sat us- no one greeted us at table. No water. No request of drinks. About 5-10 min in we were asked to move tables. We had no issue. Couldn’t actually move the sleeping baby because one of the waiters was restocking napkins. Didn’t realize. No problem. When finally moved tables. We waited there as everyone ignored us. Place was mostly empty. We got up and left. I said look we will back another time. The manager came out to talk To me. I tried to explain why I felt the service was absolutely unacceptable. He got nasty with me. Frankly this place has mediocre food and overpriced drinks. Don’t waste your money. Isabelles across the street is Better and service excellent."

The place is vibrant, full of energy, and definitely on the lively side, so expect a fun atmosphere rather than a quiet dinner.\n\nOur waiter, Timur, made the night special. He was attentive, professional, and handled all of our allergy restrictions with real care. Every dish came out perfect, and you could tell he takes pride in what he does. If you can, try to sit in his section.\n\nFood highlights:\n•\tThe red snapper was cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful.\n•\tThe short rib was slow cooked and melted in the mouth, one of the best I’ve had in a while.\n•\tFor dessert, the tahini ice cream halva dish stood out. It had a unique texture and layered flavors that I’d highly recommend.\n\nThe only miss for us was the Greek salad, which was heavy on dill and vinegar, throwing off the balance. Everything else was superb.\n\nService, food, and ambiance all get top marks from me. The restaurant does get busy, so reservations are a good idea. If you’re looking for a place with great Mediterranean food, excellent service, and a buzzing scene, Barbounia is a solid choice"

The service was excellent, and the atmosphere was stylish and inviting.\nHowever, the food was disappointing. It looked great on the plate, but it was surprisingly tasteless. As someone who enjoys gourmet food, taste matters a lot to me and this missed the mark completely. I spent over $100 and left unsatisfied. Also, the plates and dishware felt outdated for a restaurant of this level.\nIf you're going just for the ambiance and good service, you might enjoy it. But if delicious food is your priority, I wouldn’t recommend it. I won’t be returning."

The crab cakes were excellent and a different tasty taste from the usual crab cakes. We had the salmon, halibut,  and chicken kabob. The salmon was moist; the halibut was wonderful and the chicken kabob was juicy and exquisite. The chocolate and pineapple desserts were wonderful. The hostess, Estefania, was pleasant and accommodating. Our waiter, Nick,  was amazing. He seemed to know the entire menu, lol, describing the ingredients and taste of the plates we asked about. He was on point with all his recommendations. He was also patient and attentive.\nThe noise level was at a  typical  ew York high level but we were able to hear and speak at a normal level. We definitely be back!"

            "text": "Barbounia Restaurant – A Culinary Masterpiece on Park Avenue!\n\nIt’s hard to put into words how extraordinary our dining experience was at Barbounia in Manhattan. Simply put—this place 🏠 is a must!\n\nTouted as “A Mediterranean Affair,” that phrase barely scratches the surface of what awaits you. This is a one-of-a-kind dining journey through the Middle East, Lebanon, Morocco, Israel, and beyond—a vibrant explosion 💥 of flavors unlike anything you’ve tasted 😛.\n\nFrom the first bite, your tastebuds 👅 are introduced to a harmony of exotic herbs and spices.\n\nHaving little experience identifying these aromatic and tasty blends, I won’t even attempt to give a written description of what my palate was privy too.\n\nChef Mor is a true culinary artist, with the rare talent to imagine flavors in his mind and bring them to life on your plate. Watching him meticulously inspect every dish before it left the kitchen was impressive. His constant dialogue with the floor manager showed his commitment to perfection in every detail.\n\nWe felt compelled to meet him and thank him personally—this was no ordinary meal, it was a crafted experience.\n\nOur server, Grigo, was the perfect guide through the menu, leading us to unforgettable dishes that can only be described as OMG! Barbounia was buzzing inside and out—lively and energetic—but the ambiance, expertly made cocktails, and seamless service created an atmosphere of effortless sophistication.\n\nThe decor? Stunning. High ceilings, arched aisles, glowing globe lights—all set the tone. But let’s talk chairs 🪑. Cushioned, curved, and perfectly weighted, they were the most comfortable restaurant chairs I’ve ever sat in. Dining here felt like being cradled in luxury.\n\nNow the food… 🥘\n\nStarters\nWe had the hummus, Israeli salad 🥗, and grilled octopus 🐙.\n•   The hummus—silky, creamy, blended with tahini—surrounded a pool 🏊 of crushed tomatoes 🍅, cilantro 🌿, olive oil 🫒, and chickpeas. Dipping the warm bread 🥖 into it was divine. A true slice of heaven. .\n•   The octopus 🐙? So tender, paired perfectly with marinated chickpeas, chillies 🌶️, oregano 🌿, red onion 🧅, olives 🫒, and labaneh.  A great pairing of flavors.\n•   The Israeli chopped salad 🥗 was crisp, refreshing, and coated in a creamy, tangy tahini dressing, with mint, cucumbers 🥒, and crispy pita 🥙.\nThese were the perfect start.\n\nMain Courses\nEvery dish was an explosion 💥 of flavor.\n\n•   The Short Rib Tagine 🥩 was deeply aromatic—braised with Swiss chard 🥬, harissa, preserved lemon 🍋, and homemade couscous 🍚.\n\n.  It was a stew 🍲 that was so aromatic 👃 that we knew the taste would be unbelievable, which it was.\n\n•   The Roasted Chicken Shish Kebab 🐓 came with braised freekeh, peas 🫛, almonds 🥜, sumac, and the standout: a green pea tahini dip so good we all dunked our bread 🥖 in it. The peas literally burst 💥 in your mouth!  Extraordinary.\n\n•   I had the Long Island Duck Shawarma 🦆—served on forbidden black rice 🍚 with mushrooms 🍄, amba, tahini, pine nuts 🌰 & sumac. Rich, bold, and plated 🍽️ to perfection—a true masterpiece.\n\nDesserts\n•   A decadent red velvet and chocolate mousse with strawberries 🍓 and rose petals 🌹, dusted with a magical strawberry 🍓 powder.\n\n•   And the star: a tangy fruit delight crowned with cloud-like ☁️ halavah cotton candy 🪶 that melted in your mouth 😛. Beyond amazing!\n\nYes, this review is long—but deservedly so. Barbounia isn’t just a meal—it’s an unforgettable experience from start to finish.\n\nMy Final two words: “Just Go!”"

Gonzalo C. was the server who took care of us and he was truly fabulous. He took the time to help each of us with the drink and food menu, helping us select drinks and dishes that would work best for our flavor preferences. He was also consistently attentive throughout our long meal, checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a lovely experience!"

Let’s just say you might as well be royalty or a head of state.\nThe cleanliness is always impeccable, and the food… well, that’s why we’re all here, right?\n\nEvery time, it’s a new surprise on the menu — and always a delicious one.\nThe waiters remember me, the service is warm and personal, and Chef Amitsur, you’ve made my visits to Manhattan unforgettable over the past 8 years.\n\nThank you for making every meal a truly elevated experience."

From the start, it was inattentive and disorganized, and when I politely pointed it out, instead of offering a simple apology, the staff responded with awkward jokes that only made the situation more frustrating.\nA sincere acknowledgment would have gone a long way.\nGreat food can’t fully make up for poor hospitality, which is disappointing for a place with such potential!"

The atmosphere/decor is nice, music a bit too loud. The indoor seating felt very crammed, especially the ones allocated for parties of two. Our waiter (not going to mention the name) came off as not very personable, almost robotic. No intro, no recommendations, suggestions. Almost felt like - what do you want from the menu so I could go put in the order. All the servers though were very kind and attentive. The food was coming out really quick, to the point that it seemed like they want you to finish with your food so they could use the table for the next reservation. As for the food, the presentation was excellent. We had five sampler appetizer and it was amazing. For the main we had the salmon and lamb dishes. The salmon was way overcooked / almost burnt and the lamb wasn't seasoned well / missing flavor. For a $200 bill, we definitely had much higher expectations."
