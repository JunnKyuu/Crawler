They ask you at the beginning if you want any preferences and of course, I piped up about the.  “ fried chicken.”!\nThey started out with a small squash amuse  bouche, then we had some fritters, followed by a meatball “boudin ball”.\nWe also had cooked okra and a really unique potato salad. They followed with a delicious gumbo with homemade sausage. Then we had the fried chicken! Wow. Came with hot honey and one other sauce.\nThe squid in pasta and mushroom with radish on top was last before dessert.\nThe person waiting tables knew the food backwards and forwards and was a real treat to work with. (Eli!)\nThey finished the meal with a very small dessert which was kind of a strawberry and cake and whipped cream specialty.\nWe really love the meal. I found the flavors on every course just exploding in our mouth. Really enjoyed this experience and it’s a must do!"

The main dishes were the perfect portion to fill us up.\nIt was our first time here and we are neighborhood folks and the service made us feel like we are part of them so that warmth hospitality is definitely bringing us back in the future.\nFYI it’s BYOB with a small corkage fee (u less you go for the set) so stop by a local spot grab a bottle and have it with your delicious meal.\nIt such a unique menu for a neighborhood that is getting diverse."

It’s such a catchy blend of Korean and Cajun.\n\nWe had dinner for two and tried the following dishes: Kimchi Green Tomatoes, Kimchi Okra, Catfish, Hashpuppy (Cornbread), Fried Chicken, Seafood jjajangmyeon, and Strawberry Cornbread with Whipped Cream for dessert.\n\nOur favorite was the Kimchi Green Tomatoes — absolutely delicious! The catfish, however, was a bit too salty, and the fried chicken didn’t quite compare to traditional Southern buttermilk fried chicken or Bonchon’s version. The jjajangmyeon leaned on the sweet side, and the dessert was a miss for us.\n\nThe space is small but cozy, and the service was excellent. Overall, creative concept and great service, but some dishes could use a little fine-tuning."

Washrooms is in the back through the kitchen so this tells you how small the whole restaurant is.\n\nOne of our snacks came out a little cold and they gave us a brand new one as well as another snack to make up for it. Service was amazing and everyone apologized for it, even though this obviously can happen to any establishment. Zero corkage fee when choosing a set menu is amazing and I’d definitely recommend bringing a bottle if you have one, they’ll keep it on ice and provide some ice for the drinks as well.\n\nThe daikon potato and okra kimchi sides are hits, but I’m sure all the sides are good. The standouts for me were the snacks, which were the cornbread hush puppies and the japchae balls. These were so good, definitely try one or the other or both if possible.\n\nThe kimchi fried rice and brisket grits mains were both amazing. I would say the brisket grits was more unique but both were great in flavour. The fried chicken was really good but since everything was else was so unique and yummy I’d say I would recommend trying more of the other food rather than getting just chicken. Ideally adding a piece of chicken for $9 to the set menu seems like the best way to try it.\n\n10/10 recommend!!!"

The restaurant was uncomfortably hot, to the point where I couldn’t fully enjoy or even focus on the food the way I should have. Additionally, the restroom setup was disappointing; you have to walk through the kitchen while staff are working, which felt unsafe and not very sanitary.\n\nWe spent about $145 for two people (including tip), so roughly $70+ per person. At that price point, I expect not just great food but also a comfortable, enjoyable dining experience. While the food impressed me, the environment did not, and that’s why I can’t give a full 5 stars."

And then yesterday, somehow, I had a complete brain fart and only remembered it was Chef Jae when I heard her voice. Chef Jae, if you ever see this, your food is phenomenal, and A+ service. This is what dining should be, comfortable, tasty, and so good for the soul. The menu tastes exactly as it's described: a Korean-Cajun mix. It was flavorful, bold, unexpected and just so, so, so satisfying on a beautiful sunny day. Highlights were the hush puppies, rice & beans, and fried chicken. So basically the entire meal."

We ordered a fish plate at $15 and it was one small filet and no sides (picture attached). Flavor and taste ok. Also ordered 3 piece fried chicken at $27. It came with no sides and it didn't even deserve a picture.  It was greasy, flavor ok and definitely not worth $27. Small place with minimal seating.  I won't recommend this place it is way overpriced for quality of food."

Everything was cooked well, although maybe alcohol is a must if you are sensitive to salty food.\n\nWe had the $66pp family dinner and things were on the salty side. Everything that came out was salty on a scale of fine (okra kimchi/butter chips) to pretty salty (fried chicken/japchae balls) to really salty. Might just be us but we had some difficulty with the black bean noodles (jjajang), watermelon salad (in the spoons), and the strawberry dessert (the cookie crumbs). The restaurant did reach out to tell us that they would take the feedback into account! The flavor profiles were otherwise good. Maybe would come back for their lunch specials, which sound really fun.\n\nOtherwise we loved the concept and the gumbo was truly amazing. The place is a little cramped and hectic but fun, definitely more pub ish than fine dining (and drinking to help cut the oil/salt)."

            "text": "Overall for a fusion restaurant that always leaves me skeptical, it was surprisingly well done! Some dishes were more of a hit than others but I think overall the ones that worked, worked. The ones that didn’t as much- I think it can be better executed. We opted for the tasting menu which showcased all of the dishes, and with that the corkage fee was waived for us due to the size of our party. So I have to say I do appreciate the restaurant for making that accommodation.\n\nWe traveled to New York for my fiancés bday and this place was recommended by one of our friends and since we’re Korean and getting married in NOLA, this was a no brainer. It was almost meant to be that we came across this spot. The restaurant is verrryyy small and so small in order to get to the bathroom, you have to go through the very small kitchen. With that said it is a nice touch that you can see the kitchen as I’ve always been a fan of open kitchen concepts.\n\nThe service I have to say was 50-50. The person identified as a chef and owner did not seem as welcoming as she was the one manding the front door. I realize that her and her team were getting our table ready however we have been to other restaurants in New York City that were just as busy and the owner or manager was willing to take a few seconds to welcome us. On that note when we made the reservation, we were told over the phone to come earlier which we still ended up waiting about 20 to 25 minutes longer than our reservation time. However, I will say the service was made up by the wait staff because they were amazing. They were energetic, attentive, prompt, and very engaging.\n\nNow let’s move onto the food. Some of my most favorite dishes was the take on jajangmyun with squid ink, collard greens, pork ribs, and the honey butter chips. The star of the night was the okra which I do not like but in this application was delicious, a little sweet, tangy and crunchy. No dish was disappointing per se as they all tasted good, it was the fusion aspect that was lacking in some."

Got the lunch chicken sandwich special takeout, and the greeter was so incredibly kind, making sure we were comfortable while waiting.\n\nLove the kimchi stew side — tart, spicy, comforting. Easily a compliment to any dish.\n\nThe chicken had a great coating! The chili oil gave it great fragrance and the horseradish sauce paired really well with the mint and radish toppings. Love a good potato bun, duh.\n\nKimchi soup: 9.6\nChicken Sando: 9.8"

We also added an extra snack, Cornbread Hushpuppies, and had the pecan pie for dessert.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily to my taste. However, I did enjoy the hush puppies and pecan pie. One issue we had was with the chicken being undercooked. Our waitress mentioned that she wished we had spoken up so she could have fixed it, but when looked at the table next to us, their chicken seemed to be cooked similarly, so it might be the way they prepare it.\n\nAs for the service, our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but her personality just didn't click with me. She wasn't rude or anything, but I couldn't quite connect with her.\n\nGiven the experience, I'm not sure if I'll be back, but I do appreciate trying something new."

Returning this time with a friend, we were eager to see if the experience would live up to the high bar set on our inaugural visit. From start to finish, KJUN delivered a dining adventure that exceeded expectations once again.\n\nThe Appetizer\nWe began with the Cod Beignet—Mama Kim’s flaked cod enveloped in a light, crispy batter and served alongside a bright wasabi aioli. The contrast of crunchy exterior and tender fish inside was spot-on, and the gentle heat of the wasabi aioli cut through the richness, setting the tone for what was to come.\n\nMain Courses\nGalbi Brisket & Grits Galbi-marinated brisket arrived meltingly tender atop a bed of cheesy grits, with bursts of acidity from cherry tomato kimchi. Each bite balanced savory, creamy, and tangy notes in perfect harmony.\n\nSeafood Jjajangmyun Sweet potato starch noodles were bathed in a deeply umami fermented black bean sauce and studded with sautéed shrimp, calamari, and poached lobster. The unexpected addition of a cornmeal-crusted oyster added crunch and another layer of oceanic flavor.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nJust like our first visit, KJUN once again impressed with dishes that feel like a flavor festival in every bite. Chef Jae Jung’s knack for fusing textures and tastes shines through on every plate. We left already planning our next reservation—KJUN is a must-try for anyone seeking inventive Korean-inspired fare on Manhattan’s East Side."

Hush puppies - taste like ones from the south (I'm from TN). These came w this amazing honey butter dip (mix it up - so good!).\n\n3. Catfish nuggets (you don't even need the sauce they give you, it's that good)\n\n4. BBQ shrimp (this was my gf's favorite. She grew up w family near New Orleans)\n\n5. Ribs (these weren't as much of fusion but nevertheless were delicious and very tender)\n\n6. Pecan pie 🥧 - it was smaller, almost mini, made w sweet potatoes for the filling.
