My server was also really kind and attentive but not overbearing, which I appreciated very much. Started with the beef cheeks; the meat was tender and flavorful, and the polenta had a great consistency, not too salty either. However, the greens were a little too rich for my liking. Overall, not a bad dish. Crispy potatoes were also great. What really stood out was the Mas Amiel Maury 1969 after-dinner wine. The manager/sommelier, was so kind to pour my glass and explain the reason why this wine was such a big deal. The manager was so generous to bring us an amazing dessert to pair with the wine, the chocolate Budino. All I can say is that dessert was crack! I was then wowed, and I knew this was hospitality at its finest. Definitely will be back."

            "text": "I wanted to share the experience I had dining at Isabelle's Osteria this past Tuesday 6/24/25.\n\nI made a reservation for 6:30pm on Tuesday 6/24/25 about a week in advance for my partner's 40th birthday celebration. After a spectacular day, we were very excited to try our Isabelle's for the first time, having been recommended to this restaurant by many clients who live in the area.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated in a lovely corner booth - perfect for an intimate birthday dinner. Not long after sitting, we realized that it was uncomfortably warm inside the restaurant. Eventually we were hot enough that I went to ask the hostess who told us \"Oh yeah, the AC is broken.\" Keep in mind, this was the hottest day of the year with record breaking temperatures of 101*. I asked - \"Don't you think this is something you should have disclosed when we arrived? We could have made the decision to go somewhere else.\" She had no response.\n\nAlso, if I can be sent 2-3 reminder texts to confirm my upcoming reservation, can I not be forewarned that the AC is not working in 100* weather?\n\nOur waiter arrived at our table nearly 20 minutes after we sat down. We ordered everything all at once, having had plenty of time to peruse the menu.The wine and starters came out relatively quickly, and were delicious.\n\nHowever, our waiter was dealing with a larger party (10-12 people) and did not come back to check on us once. After waiting for 1 hour and 20 minutes in the unbearable heat, our food finally arrived. Because of a combo of the heat and excessive wait time, we flagged down the nearby hostess and asked that our food be packed to go, as we no longer wanted to be in the restaurant. We were polite, but she could see our extreme displeasure, from the heat, the long wait, and the missing waiter.\n\nAs a kicker, the busser who brought us our food inappropriately and snidely quipped \"Too hot for you?\" when dropping off the bags.\n\nThe hostess was kind enough to ask for our meals to be comped (which they were), and we of course paid for the wine and starters we had.\n\nOverall, this was a truly horrible experience. Though I understand that a broken AC may not be in the restaurant's control, all of the other circumstances surrounding this could have been handled better. A simple communicative warning, an informed hostess, an attentive waiter, and/or food taking less than an hour and twenty minutes to arrive on a not-packed Tuesday evening would have made this somewhat pleasurable.\n\nThis ended up being the one black mark on an otherwise perfect 40th birthday celebration."

I got one and it was fine, nothing special, but I ordered another. The second drink arrived and I was immediately puzzled. It was objectively not the same drink as the first round (see photo). I debated saying something but after tasting it I realized I had to: it tasted nothing like the first. So I say something and the staff is lowkey pissed at me for it. The bartender comes out to assure me that he made it the exact same way he did the first time. I really didn’t mean to offend him or his craft but I just wanted a Hugo and this was NOT a Hugo. Anyway he made me another and it was fine but a crowd of employees watched me drink the entire thing and it was a weird vibe overall. I don’t want to hold a grudge but, come on, that isn’t the same drink and I felt gaslit. Perhaps I am just sensitive"

I immediately thought this was the absolute perfect temperature and combination of crispy and almost creamy.   I was worried it would be too hot from their warning of the hot plate.

Fennel salad and Chicken Milanese was my choices. The salad came first. It was nicely seasoned and had a bite with the walnuts and creaminess with Parmesan and lemon. I could only eat half the portion. Then came the chicken but where was it? Under the arugula! The dinner plate sized crispy chicken had a bowler hat of arugula, thinly sliced red onions and cherry tomatoes. This was a toothsome entrée which I enjoyed but once again found it too big a helping and got it packed to take home. The large amount of arugula made it spill onto the table which was the one thing I didn’t care for. . Nestor created a mocktail with passion fruit juice that complimented my lunch nicely. Both he and Jesus were personable and professional. We talked about the chicken which is not on the regular menu but a strong contender as it was the most popular entrée during this Restaurant Week special event. I enjoy eating at Isabelle’s Osteria having been here a few times. It is relaxing and no one is hurried out.\n\nHighly recommended!"

But best of all is the service, Jesus was so attentive and really cared about our group having a good experience. He was very detailed and didn’t skip a single beat! Just a truly delightful restaurant!"

Pasta cooked perfectly, and calamari with fried lemon slices is just perfection 👍 good bottomless mimosas (they used good alcohol and not something that gives you a headache an hour later)…"

It's typically pricey so good for expense accounts and special occasions. I liked that the lower level bathroom was sleek and didn't feel like a basement bathroom typical in the area. Food presentation was attractive."

            "text": "Named after a playful nickname given to the chef’s mom, this establishment is located on Park Avenue South in Gramercy Park. Opened in late 2020, Isabelle’s Osteria features Italian and Mediterranean cuisine, adding unusual touches to traditional appetizers and entrees. My partner and I came for brunch as first-timers. Reservations were easily made via Open Table. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the host and got seated promptly. The restaurant has a nice, well-thought-out interior with a classy vibe, but one could come in casual. We decided on the Poached Eggs with polenta, oyster mushrooms, & Chicken and Waffles with sourdough waffles and calabrian chili syrup. Every dish was amazing tasty and well seasoned. Portion sizes were on point. Akif, our server, was knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. He was helpful with choosing our drinks and food. Prices were comparable to the area. Their food quality and attention to detail made the experience stand out, which we can recommend."

            "text": "There’s great menu items at Isabelle’s Osteria, but there’s also some items which are mediocre at best.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered and enjoyed the burrata, crispy calamari, roasted octopus, fluke crudo, and tuna tartare. Out of these, I personally enjoyed the fluke crudo, tuna tartare, and roasted octopus the most. We also ordered the roasted beets and meatballs but did not enjoy these as much.\n\nWe tried the tuscan kale salad, which was better than I expected.\n\nI tried the cannelloni, which was very tasty and unique! Had great flavors. A few of my colleagues ordered and enjoyed the mushroom lasagna very much, but personally did not try this.\n\nFor my entrée, I ordered the prime NY strip, which is 14 oz. It was quite large and filling, but I must say quite disappointing. I asked for medium rare, and it was definitely overcooked. Steak was not very tender or marbled. I would not recommend the steak.\n\nAs a side, we also ordered the crispy brussel sprouts which I loved! Would definitely recommend if you’re a fan of brussel sprouts.\n\nFor dessert, I had the tirimisu and gelato (comes with 3 scoops). The gelato flavors were vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. Gelato was average, but the tirimisu was great. A colleague got the gelato parfait and it was HUGE.\n\nAs for cocktails, I enjoyed the park avenue passion. My colleague got the amalfini which visually surprised us, because it came with a picture of the mona lisa lasered on! Apparently, if you scan the QR code on the menu, you can even customize the image. Certainly fun and quirky.\n\nIsabelle’s Osteria probably wouldn’t be on the top of my list of recommendations, but if you do visit, there are certainly some decent menu items; but also some which might be a bit disappointing."
