Great for a date or client meeting. Good service."

Had the bara chirashi don lunch set which came with miso soup and salad. Added on ikura.\n\nFish was amazingly fresh and worked well with the avocado and Japanese egg cubes. I’m reminiscing of my lunch there. Was one of my best Japanese meals in the city and I need to return soon.\n\nPortion was large enough I didn’t feel hungry leaving the restaurant. Pretty good value.\n\nWaitstaff was okay, friendly enough."

We bid on the tuna cheek and eye and got both - one tip is that people up their bids last minute so be wary. They honored our second highest bid even when someone tried to outbid us once the auction had closed, was very kind of them. I also recommend requesting to sit at the bar for the auction as you receive a lot of attention from both the host cutting up the tuna as well as waiters for the service. The waiters, staff and hosts were all top notch - very personable and kind. I brought my boyfriend for his birthday and he had the best time. This is a fabulous date or gift experience."

It’s best to come here really hungry because the portion is big. The kids sushi boat was so fun also. At $15, it came with a mini salmon chirashi, karage, tomago, fruit, sausage and a hidden treat in the boat! My husband ordered the sashimi bowl, which had a maximum limit of 5 servings per day. He loved the sashimi bowl so much and this was the best sushi he had in the U.S. so far! So thankful to my sister in law treating us to this amazing meal.\n\nThe restaurant was almost fully packed when we arrived. We came just a little after the opening time also. Best to come extra early or make a reservation. The decor was modern yet luxurious and the bathrooms were clean and nicely scented like a Japanese wood (I forget the name).\n\nWe saw the main chef from our table. The sushi chefs were super busy for sure!\n\nWe can’t wait to visit NYC and eat here again!"

We all were satisfied with the entire experience. We probably spent more than 2 hours there and never felt they were rushing us. The price was also a positive point of our visit. I highly recommend this place.\n\nOn a totally side note, the charge of my friend's cellphone was super low and as a surprise, the server told us about they having a charging station.

            "text": "Disappointing Sushi at Wokuni – Proceed with Caution\n\nI went to Wokuni for dinner and started on a high note with the oysters—they were fresh, well-presented, and hit the spot. But the sashimi platter quickly turned things sour.\n\nThe platter arrived with five types of fish (15 pieces total). First up was the salmon, which smelled faintly fishy—definitely not sushi-grade fare. It felt like something rolled out of Costco’s fresh case. The fluke that followed was similarly lackluster, lacking the clean, fresh quality sashimi should have.\n\nThe sea bass was a slight improvement, and the yellowtail was acceptable, though still not outstanding. But the real disappointment came with the tuna. I found a visible blood vein running through the flesh—unappetizing and easily avoidable with proper trimming.\n\nI flagged it and asked the server what was going on. He took it to the chef, who came back and told me, “This is how Japanese eat sashimi.” That apology—or lack thereof—was laughable and insulting. Any competent sushi chef knows the bloodline is removed because it’s strong-tasting, off-putting, and hardly appetizing. If the chef can’t be bothered to properly clean their fish, what else are they cutting corners on?\n\nBottom line: Inspect your sashimi before you eat it. My experience was disgusting and incredibly disappointing. This level of carelessness isn’t what I expect for sushi. I won’t be returning, and I can’t recommend Wokuni to anyone who cares about quality or value."

I can’t recall exactly what we ordered since my colleagues did most of the choosing, but everything we had was genuinely impressive.\n\nWe tried a wide range of dishes, including different types of sushi, eel, salmon, and squid. I was especially surprised by the raw salmon. I honestly thought I’d struggle with it, but it turned out to be smooth, fresh, and unexpectedly delicious.\n\nWe also had two types of sake, both of which complemented the meal nicely. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the seating felt comfortable and well thought out. It made for a very relaxed dining experience.\n\nThe bill came to just over $270 for three people. It was a little on the expensive side for me personally, but considering the variety and quality of the food, I’d say it was still worth it.\n\nFor someone new to Japanese cuisine, this was a great first experience. I’d definitely recommend it to others who are curious to try something different."

Вместо традиционного сета, состоящего в основном из сырой рыбы, здесь было множество приготовленных блюд, что сделало ужин интересным опытом.\n\nАтмосфера:\nЗаведение приятно удивило уютной и стильной обстановкой. Стол сервирован с вниманием к деталям, что сразу настраивает на качественное гастрономическое путешествие.\n\nБлюда:\n•\tСалат с мини-анчоусами — свежий, с лёгкой кислинкой, что отлично открывает аппетит.\n•\tКарпаччо из хамачи с халапеньо — тонкие ломтики рыбы с балансом пряности и легкой кислинки. Очень удачное сочетание.\n•\tТемпура креветки в кремовом соусе — одна из моих любимых позиций. Креветки нежные, с идеально хрустящей оболочкой, а соус добавляет сливочную глубину вкуса.\n•\tЧерная треска с мисо — безусловный фаворит вечера! Рыба невероятно мягкая, глазурь из мисо придаёт ей нежную сладость. Обязательно к заказу.\n•\tУтиная грудка — с тонкой хрустящей корочкой и сочной текстурой, подаётся с минималистичным гарниром.\n•\tСуши сет — классика, которая здесь сделана с высокой точностью и свежестью. Уник с морским ежом тает во рту.\n•\tДесертное ассорти — от традиционного моти до интересной подачи шоколадного торта. Завершение ужина с восточным акцентом.\n\nОбслуживание:\nХороший сервис, внимательный, но ненавязчивый персонал. Все блюда подавались с нужными интервалами, позволяя наслаждаться ужином без спешки.\n\nИтог:\nWokuni — это идеальное место для тех, кто хочет попробовать омакасе с акцентом на приготовленные блюда. Великолепные морепродукты, точность исполнения, уютная атмосфера — сюда хочется вернуться. Рекомендую для тех, кто ценит высокое качество японской кухни, но не готов останавливаться только на классическом суши-баре."

The dishes he recommended were fantastic , and the service was friendly and efficient,  at no time did we feel rushed even though the restaurant was full. We definitely recommend Wokuni.

As a regular customer, I am always impressed by their commitment to excellence, from their fresh sushi sourced directly from their fish farm in Japan to the perfectly grilled hamachi collar. The agedashi tofu is a comforting delight with its crispy exterior and silky interior, while the matcha and mochi ice cream is the perfect sweet finish. Our go-to sake, Dassai Nama, pairs beautifully with every dish.  A unique recent addition to their sushi counter is a silent fish auction screen above their sushi bar counter was a nice touch.  Their happy hour drink specials and Arigato set (fried chicken or oyster with Edamame) are a great deal and delicious 😋"

The presentation is fabulous and everything tastes very nice!\n\nA must try place for any Japanese food lover.\n\nOriginal Nov 2023:\nVery nice sushi restaurant which does a live Tuna cutting experience every month (3rd Tuesday of each month). Make reservations and tell them you are interested in seeing the Tuna slicing.\n\nThe food is good, fish is fresh with many of the usual options. The rice seems a bit off for me, lacks enough vinegar and is super white in color. The rolls, sashimi, sushi and tempura items are super nice. The chicken karage, shrimp tempura and O Toro is exceptional. The Medai nigiri was ok.\n\nThe liquor selection is superb. Yamazaki’s, Hibiki and Hakushu (including 18’s). A wide selection of high end Sake with a few sake flights. The lychee martini is exceptional.\n\nThey have a regular bar to sit and also a sushi bar. The service is very friendly and prompt.

The chicken karagge were really good and so were the drinks. However, the bowls and sushi rolls we got were super bland and unflavorful. I was expecting sushi rice in our bowl and the roll, but it was just regular white rice. I remembered they had sushi rice last time I ordered delivery. For $40 per bowl, I would expect a little better than this. Sadly, there are many other places nearby that also have sushi bowls so I wouldn't recommend this place."

I don’t understand this amount at all.” We were almost forced to pay the tip even though it wasn’t something special when paying 150+ for food. I’m not sure if I want to revisit this place although I really liked the food."

Every dish was a masterpiece – from the incredibly fresh fish to the perfectly crafted sushi and the heavenly desserts. The flavors were rich and balanced, and the presentation was top-notch. You can tell that great care goes into every detail, from the ingredients to the atmosphere. Easily one of the best restaurants I’ve ever visited. I can’t wait to come back!"

Also every Tuesday they have a live tuna auction when they cut a huge tuna fish flown from their own farm, it was entertaining, educational and very delicious, and surprisingly affordable!\nThe ambiance is sexy and understated, the service was extremely nice and we will be back for sure."

A must !!!\n\nHowever their oyster doesnt lived up my expectations considering it has some stone clumps and kinda small\n\nTheir totoro was good but the plating looks kinda  out of theme comparing to the other dishes that were plated aesthetically!"
