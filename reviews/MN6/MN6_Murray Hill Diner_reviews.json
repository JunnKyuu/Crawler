            "text": "I was charged $28.30 for an egg white greek omelette, toast, and no potatoes.  That was a direct delivery so there were no grubhub fees.  I am accustomed to over paying in Manhattan but this was ridiculous.  I actually called them when I saw this and they didn't care.  Any New Yorker knows that we get burnt omelettes from diners.  I have literally had to learn to eat burnt eggs.  My 89 year old mother complains about this all of the time.  Of course, my egg white omelette was burnt (and I have lowered my standards to survive in Manhattan), but I found it egregious that I was charged this amount of money for egg whites, tomatoes, feta, spinach and two pieces of bread."

Great bang for your buck.\n\nAtmosphere: 4.5/5 — Old-school diner charm with that classic NYC feel.

In terms of atmosphere, you can expect the usual diner sounds (dishes, people chatting, coffee slurping, etc), a decent amount of natural light because of the windows on two sides, booth seating, and classic diner bar stools. I've only done take-out and dine-in but in both scenarios, they've been very efficient."
