The food was delicious, particularly the pastrami flatbread and chicken schnitzel sandwich.\n\nThe prime rib hummus was also a standout while the crispy artichokes were okay. Our server was a little standoffish and not helpful when we asked for recommendations but we managed.\n\nMy one tip to the restaurant – – please add handles to your to go bags."

It’s absolutely worth the hype and the hard to get reservation.\n\nFirst of all, the restaurant is so nice. It’s spacious, beautifully designed, has warm lighting, vibrant energy and buzzing with people.\n\nThe service was just as impressive. Every staff member was attentive and kind, and I have to give a special shoutout to the manager, Ronald. True five-star service is rare these days and he made us feel genuinely welcome.\n\nNow the food - absolutely delicious! My favorites were the lamb kebab and the classic hummus with laffa, soft, warm, and perfect. The added tahini and s’chug was 😘Every dish was fresh, full of flavor and beautifully presented. And the dessert was amazing!\n\nI already made reservations for December! If I could give more than five stars, I would.\nWonderful restaurant. Wonderful service. Incredible food."

An wonderful place to dine.\n\nFood: Mediterranean flavor with an Israeli twist an a high class spin. Delicious flavorful and fresh. Every dish was delicious. Often a plate has a good dish here or there but this place the entire menu is delectable.\n\nService: Excellent well mannered service. From the moment we walked in and were shown our table every server smiled at us politely. Dishes were fresh yet every single dish we ordered came quickly despite the full crowd\n\nAmbiance: Mediterranean Greek vibe. Well decorated. Simple and classy. Comfortable seating and cozy. It does get crowded and a little noisy but not to a bothersome level.\n\nExpect to pay about 100 per person but very well worth it. All across the bird from food to service this place excels in. Come here and expect to be wowed."

At first, we were told we could wait for the first-come-first-serve bar seating, but to our surprise, the staff found us a table as soon as one opened up. Everyone was so kind and efficient — really impressive given how busy it was.\nThe food was amazing — simple, fresh, and full of flavor. Their plain pita bread was incredible, the salad was super fresh, and the hummus with beef was an unexpected highlight. Turkish oven pita with ground beef is a must-try. You get a little pair of scissors to cut through it! I regret not ordering it myself, but I did steal a bite and it was easily one of the best things we had.\nThe only thing I didn’t love was the spicy margarita — a bit too syrupy for me. We skipped dessert since we were already full and nothing from the ice-cream-based options really stood out.\nOverall, though, the experience was wonderful — great food, lovely service, and a buzzing atmosphere. We’ll definitely be back!"

My suggestion is order a bunch of plates and do family style cause you're going to want everything on the menu. My favorites were the mushroom hummus and the haloumi cheese on skewers with a glaze that was out of this world!!! Also the staff was attentive and truly cared about our dining experience. Feels like the real deal and I'm so happy Motek is here in NYC. Welcome to the neighborhood we needed you :) Hope to bring all my friends back soon (and you should too)!"

The service was outstanding, friendly and attentive from start to finish. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the prices are more than fair for the quality you get.\n\nI can’t recommend this place enough — everyone needs to go and enjoy this Mediterranean cuisine. Motek has definitely become one of my new favorite spots in the city!"

Out waiter Tasha was very helpful and made us feel very welcomed. My favorite was tuna tartar and watermelon/ feta salad. Also zataar fries definitely are worth coming back. Babaganush comes with a freshly baked bread, heavenly.\nWe got lucky to walk in on the opening day for brunch and definitely want to come back for dinner. Variety of seating options including tables, booths, two bar counters, a separate seating area downstairs plus a few tables outside."

            "text": "Motek is an absolute gem and going to be a new staple of Israeli cuisine in Manhattan! The vibe is very Miami/Tel Aviv with lively music and trendy decor. The staff are extremely professional and kind. But the best part- the food! Every dish we had was a hit. Also something really cool- on the status of if they are kosher or not- all of the meat is Glatt Kosher and prepared separately from the dairy, so even though the restaurant itself is not certified kosher, if you keep kosher and are okay with that it’s an amazing option for kosher meat!!!\n\nWe had many dishes but I want to highlight two. We got the steak which was prepared perfectly- I highly suggest! And for dessert we had the halva black sesame ice cream. I’ve eaten at a lot of places in the city and this dish was absolutely unique. I have never had something quite like how they prepared it. Highly suggest that too!\n\nYou won’t regret going to Motek!"

The classic hummus and beef pide dish were my favorites.  We go the babaganuosh too, and although it was fresh, I felt like it was missing a spice / seasoning to it.   Chicken schnitzel sandwich also good.\n\nOn the space - definitely strong Miami vibes and attracts that kind of crowd.   (Makes sense since it’s from Miami….)\n\nWould say one downside space wise is that tables are tiny, so it feels a bit cramped especially when you’re sharing food.\n\nNice spot overall with good people watching and decent food."
