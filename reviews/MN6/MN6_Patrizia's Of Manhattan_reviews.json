I had seen this restaurant on YouTube before and they are known for their Star shaped pizza.\n\nWe decided to try it out for lunch and I'm glad we did.  We ordered the fried anchovies, pizza egg rolls, carbonara pasta, and a margarita star shaped pizza.\n\nThe appetizers were spot on! It's not the salty anchovies that have been fermented, but Fresh anchovies! The egg rolls were actually really good and it made sense.\n\nThe Carbonara was solid, but the Star -shaped pizza was amazing.  I imagine that all the pizza is really good there. I say this because the crust was crispy and fluffy at the same time.  The star pieces were also stuffed with cheese!  In terms of pizza, one of the best slices I've had in a while.\n\nI would recommend this place for any visitor or tourist.  The pizza itself is worth it."

We ordered a few pasta dishes, a pizza, two different chicken dishes and some drinks. Food was tasty and the service was attentive. The atmosphere could benefit from an awning over the space as there were some birds flying around, but overall a good experience and would return."

Pasta was SO undercooked. I had to throw away half of it because it was so hard and the pieces were all stuck together. Like they just left it in the boiling water without stirring it once. and no they were not busy at ALL so what was the excuse. The place was in fact pretty empty.\n3. They were missing so many things from the menu (steak, veal, tartufo). And we wanted alot of these things so that was disappointing.\n\nThe place looked like some open cafeteria style lunch room. Didn't feel classy or date night worthy whatsoever. Not to mention my stomach felt uneasy after this meal- After the salad I already had my concerns about how clean things really are in the kitchen.\n\nWill not be returning to this location at all. Very disappointing birthday dinner. Only good thing I can say was the waiter was very nice and did his job."

The food was fresh, and we could taste it was made with love. It seemed as if the pasta sauce was homemade, I am unsure! My personal favorite dishes that we chosen from the prix menu were the burratas and chicken scarpariello *if that was the one with peppers* the smoke was good. The staff was very attentive to our table, despite other parties of 15, and 5 birthday parties. A great place for groups with amazing music.

When I cut into it, I found the bread filled with nothing but half-melted, unappetizing cheese (see the picture). I looked through the remainder and the only other ingredients I found were 3-5 slivers of basil. Will not order from here again."

The food was fresh and soooo good, portions are large too. I really enjoyed the calamari, mozzarella sticks and veal parmigiana and can still taste the food days later. Highly recommend this spot."
