We were so impressed by every single dish, they were packed with umami, and the texture of them were amazing too. The food babies we had after finishing everything were soooo worth it! The staff was super kind too! I can’t recommend this restaurant enough! Best of luck x\n\nUpdate: we went again on our last day in NYC, we still liked what we got but somehow the dishes were not as good as the first time… we got crab fried rice, crispy pork belly with basil, summer roll and mango sticky rice.\n\nOn weekend nights it’s better to get reservations, but be prepared for a very loud environment. Weekdays are better and normally you don’t need a reservation."

Pure happiness in one bite 💥\n🦀 Softshell Crab Karee\nCrispy on the outside, tender inside — the softshell crab is coated in a mild curry sauce that’s both sweet and slightly spicy. So flavorful and layered — definitely my favorite dish of the night!\n🐟 Crispy Sea Bass\nThe sea bass is perfectly fried — crisp on the outside, juicy and flaky inside. The tangy-sweet sauce complements it perfectly. Best enjoyed hot and shared with friends!\n🥭 Mango Sticky Rice\nSave room for dessert!

My friend and I came here for lunch on a Saturday and it was a good thing we made reservations because the place got packed pretty quickly.\n\nThe food was excellent!  We ordered the veggie spring rolls (accompanied with the lunch special) and the chive pancakes as our appetizer, which were lightly-fried and paired very nicely with the pancake sauce.  My friend ordered the noodles with vegetarian duck, and I ordered their famous crab fried rice.  Both were super fresh and perfectly-cooked.  I took my remaining dish home as a leftover and it still tasted awesome when I had it for dinner a few hours later.\n\nFor drinks, we ordered a Thai iced tea, lychee martini, and Mezcal sour.  They all tasted great – not too sweet and with the perfect hint of an alcohol aftertaste for the cocktails.\n\nAll the servers were also friendly and helpful.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this spot for a delicious Thai dining experience in a fun atmosphere!"

Most places in New York only have shrimp/prawns in their tom yum. The soup was spicy, flavorful, and the seafood was fresh. We also got the oysters, which were a great size and also fresh. The last thing we got was chicken pad kee mao, which was great. The drinks were also amazing, we got the lychee martini and the yuzu margarita. The decor of the restaurant is also very modern and so was the cutlery and dinnerware, and made the experience even more enjoyable."

When we left it started to pick up a bit. Curry puffs were delicious. I had the khao soi, friend had some crispy seafood dish. It was all tasty"

We picked it because it was convenient, and we were so happy we did. Definitely one of the best Thai spots around. You have to try the tod mun and crab fried rice. We’ll be back for sure to try more dishes!"

I tried the featured mango fizz cocktail which was yummy.\nFrom looking around at other diners, I think the lunch special is a good deal.\nThe only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I felt rushed out the door; I was barely finished when the server brought the machine over for me to pay."

            "text": "Malii Gramercy feels like an actual Gem find. I chose this place to try because of restaurant week 2024 and needless to say, I will be coming back here in my own time.\nIt is located in the heart of gramercy and close to stuy town.\nThe inside felt modern-rustic and the outside of the building looked minimalistic and unsuspecting.\nThe waitress sat us down immediately. I went at exactly 11:30AM so they were still setting up, but some of party was late anyways so she gave us some time while preparing the area.\nThe furniture inside were clean and well-maintained.\nThe food, was fire (I have no other words to describe it in taste and physical feeling)\nIt had a nice kick to it. They have a huge selection for restaurant week 2024 and it was all $30 per person for lunch. With tip and tax, it came to about $40 per person.\n\nI got the lime fried chicken and the ribs. I would 100% recommend this place to my friends and families.\n\n**note it was too cold inside, the NYC weather was hovering around 75F at the time and people were wearing shorts and they had the AC blasting. They were kind of enough to turn it off when I had asked them to."

We have our favorites in the menu - Crab fried rice, Vermicelli shrimp noodle and pork belly appetizer matched up with the Thai iced tea soooo gooooood. We usually come here every month with the same dishes we usually order. Shoutout to Hero, Anne T, Sohi & Joanne\n\nCathelyne"

They had your classics (like the chicken pad thai) but also had some fun dishes like the crab fried rice pictured below. We started with cocktails (the moscow mules and margs) which were excellent! And then for an appetizer we got the shrimp and pork steamed dumplings. A bit bummed they came with 5 and not 6 so we could split them evenly, but they were very tasty. We also got the crispy pork belly which had a delicious basil sauce.\n\nService was good, vibes were good. Would come back again."

            "text": "The restaurant was really nice. Such a nice vibe and it felt very welcoming. The servers were very attentive and I always appreciate good service. I went in with a friend and we shared all of our food.\n\nI order the Mule cocktail. It was very refreshing but it lacked some punch. It could have used a touch more spirit but I wasn't there for the drinks so it's okay.\n\nI wasn't too thrilled with the appetizers. They looked very pretty and are very instagrammable but they lacked flavor. It kinda made us worried that the whole meal was going to be bland. The Duck Bun needed more sauce in it and the Branzino Fresh Rolls were hard to eat and flavorless without the side sauce. Maybe that's the way they're supposed to be enjoyed but I wasn't the biggest fan. Not terrible.\n\nFor our entrees, we were going to be adventurous and try something we've never had before but after the apps, we wanted to get something we were used to. We ordered the Squid Pad Thai, the Panang Curry and for the wild card, the went with the Basil Crispy Pork Belly. Those dishes were all excellent. A complete different experience from the apps. The flavors, the textures, the plating, everything went right with the entrees. I would possibly go back again to try the dishes we originally planned on getting like the Lychee Duck Curry."

Kudos to whomever decorated the place because it's a very artistic. The staff was very welcoming and greeted us immediately, took our orders and it came out in a timely manner. Didn't have to wait long at all. And the food was AMAZINGGGG.. everyone REALLY enjoyed their meals. The drinks weren't watered, and it give us a buzz. This place definitely deserves checking out. It's very intimate and cozy, not for a huge crowd. I'm sure you'll like the experience."

We had the following:\n\n- mussels: 6/5 so good!\n- shrimp lollipop: 4/5 more of a shrimp croquette and was good, only 2.\n- ribs: 4/5 the ribs were sooo spicy!! Like be prepared spicy.\n- crab curry: 4/5 there was a pepper in the dish that almost burned my mouth of bc it was so spicy so just be prepared. The crab was good, but the star of the show was definitely the curry!\n\nThe service was amazing and I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Not too loud, super chill, and gorgeously decorated.\n\nHighly recommend!"
