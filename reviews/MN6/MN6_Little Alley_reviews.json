We unintentionally got to the restaurant still within dim sum happy hour pricing so got a variety of little things like soup dumplings, scallion pancakes. Overall, solid choices. For main dishes, I really loved the prawns and would definitely recommend. The menu is fairly extensive and we tried a few things but I feel like there's much more! While nothing stood out as truly stellar, it was all fairly good and reasonably priced."

The Xiao Long Bao (pork soup dumplings) are not my type since their wraps are too thick. A surprise is that the restaurant offers a curry fried rice where it's difficult to find among other Chinese restaurants."

And truly, the other dishes we had were standout. Just don't make the same mistakes we did. 🙏\n\nOverall, the food and service was very attentive, but don't bother with the preserved vegetables with pork belly. I don't think it sells well and I can see why. It was only like 7 thin slices of pork on a bulging mound of preserved vegetables. Unfortunately, those vegetables also tasted off. We notified the staff at the time and they immediately said they'd take it off our bill. Luckily, two of our party didn't eat much of the vegetables, but our third had eaten a couple mouthfuls by the time we reflected on how it tasted old. The next day their stomach was unsettled the whole day.\n\nPea shoots also weren't as great as we were expecting. I'm not sure if it's because they had to remake ours because we made a mistake the first time when ordering it, but it wasn't as flavourful as we expected and didn't seem to have as much seafood as the photo. (Our mistake: we thought the stir-fried option would include all the seafood and egg in it just no broth, but that wasn't the case, it was just more vegetables--staff was understanding and changed it for us).\n\nOutside of those two dishes! The food was great. Highlights were the salted egg fish fillet and fish blossom. The former was probably my favourite; super light and fluffy coating, fish was soft and succulent, and the egg flavour was rich. The latter's flavour was on par to what I've had in China, and I liked how it came with some shrimp. First time having crispy eel, and that was really good. Pig ear was too."

The staff is really friendly and responsive, the food could be better though.\n\nLittle Alley is a quick and easy restaurant for a casual night out, or casual date. They do a lot of takeout as well and the service is great.\n\n- My favorite dish I ordered was the pork soup dumplings.\n- The lion's head entree is pretty unique... You'll like it if you enjoy soft, less cooked pork meat, but the meat was overall undercooked and the texture a bit too raw for my liking. The bok choy may have been my favorite part of the dish.\n- The Dong Po Pork with steamed buns may have been my second favorite dish I ordered. The meat was a bit dry, the sauce and fat made up for it, but it wasn't excellent. The buns made for a good bite when assembled together.\nI didn't ask if they put msg in their food, but I'm quite sensitive to Monosodium glutamate, which is used in East Asian restaurants a lot, and I didn't feel great after the meal.\n- The fish fillet in red wine sauce has a very soft texture and gooey sauce that just melts/falls off when picked up. The sauce was a bit too thick and greesy for my liking. Probably not the best quality fish out there either. The dish has wood ear and snow peas, which are always a nice add of fresh veggies.\n- The cocktails were ok. I liked that the bartender made adjustments to my drink e.g., no sugar/simple syrup or substitutions of alcohol, which was nice. I got the cucumber Class 3-2 which was a little bitter but unlike any other cocktail I've had before, so I enjoyed it."

If you time things right, you can see them being made at this station that is visible to the restaurant.  My personal favorite are the crab soup dumplings but the pork ones certainly don't disappoint. The pan fried pork buns are made of happiness and sunshine as are the vegetable dumplings. Honestly I can't say much beyond everything I've tried here had been phenomenal. My guests from out of town were also very impressed.\n\nAmbiance wise, it's very posh and the service has always been fast, friendly and attentive. They have upbeat Asian music music playing in a moody, modern atmosphere. There is a small discount available if you pay your bill in cash."

We had “Adorable Women” and “Wife”. Both were refreshing and tasty with pretty looks.\n\nLittle Alley Lion's Head is decent, the meat was firm and the salted duck egg was flavorful. We had their Yanduxian which is signature soup among Shanghai cuisines. The soup broth was flavorful with various ingredients."

The jellyfish has a very strange texture and came with a tasty sauce.  A good experience, but jellyfish just is not particularly delicious.  The rest of the dishes were wonderful.  Plated beautifully and prepared perfectly, they were tasty and well cooked with all the right flavors and textures.  Go with a group so you can order and try many things!\n\nThe beers they had were also very unique and quite tasty!"

CheLi is great but it's more on the refined + interesting end of Shanghainese food and doesn't quite hit the mark for full nostalgic. Little Alley on the other hand - SPOT ON!\n\nIn particular, their smoked carps, ma lan tou, snow pea shoot in rich broth, rice dumpling in rice wine, and pumpkin cakes were PERFECT. Unfortunately, their baby eel wasn't quite right flavorwise (missing some white pepper maybe), and their mini wontons were too thick.\n\nWould still unequivocally recommend this spot though!\n\nLow key ambiance and excellent service as well!"
