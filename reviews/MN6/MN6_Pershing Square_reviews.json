Food was not cheap but then neither was the quality of the food and service - so we felt it was worth the money and experience. Lovely cozy and old world feel but very busy and fairly noisy. We manage to time it right with a visit around 830 as it was starting to fill up by the time we left. I would recommend and visit again should we get the opportunity to visit NYC again."

            "text": "We decided to try this restaurant for breakfast after hearing a recommendation, thinking it might be a worthwhile splurge. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment from start to finish.\n\nRight away, the prices raised eyebrows — a single Belgian waffle was around $24, as were the pancakes and omelette. Even a small cup of orange juice or coffee was $10 each. Still, we figured the quality or portion sizes might justify the cost. Sadly, that wasn’t the case.\n\nWhen the food arrived, the portions were surprisingly small. The omelette was a basic single-pan size, and the pancakes came as a small stack of three or four. Worse, the quality didn’t match the upscale pricing. The eggs over medium were cold and overcooked on the outside, clearly from a griddle that was too hot, and even after being sent back, they returned warm but still burned. The pancakes looked nice at first but were doughy and undercooked in the middle — again, a sign of rushed or uneven cooking.\n\nFor such steep prices, the food was plain, poorly prepared, and nowhere near the level of quality you’d expect. Honestly, the Dunkin’ Donuts across the street could have provided a better breakfast for a fraction of the cost.\n\nOverall, the experience was disappointing and not worth the premium price. If you’re looking to spend a little more for great breakfast food, you’re better off taking your money somewhere that actually delivers on flavor and quality."

            "text": "I was really looking forward to a nice breakfast, but my experience here was pretty underwhelming, especially for the price. I ordered eggs that cost $22, and they arrived cold and frazzled, as if they’d been sitting out for a while. Unfortunately, the rest of the food didn’t make up for it. The pancakes were doughy, the toast was hard, and the waffles were dry—none of it tasted fresh or worth the high cost. Even small details were disappointing; the napkins felt like thin pieces of paper. On top of that, both the food and drinks were noticeably overpriced for what you get.\n\nOverall, this meal felt like poor value for money. If you’re considering coming here for breakfast or brunch, I’d recommend looking elsewhere for better quality and a fairer price."

The waiter joked, “I won’t charge too much,” but then processed two unauthorized charges on my card — one for $90 and another for $72 (where only one should have been taken).\nWe had only one bill and one payment, so these extra charges are clearly fraudulent.\n\nI’ve tried several times to contact the business via Instagram, their website, and direct messages, but have received no response at all.\n\nThis feels like deliberate misuse of payment information, and the lack of accountability is unacceptable.

There are two doors and the lady who came down to open them could clearly see us standing at one set of doors but for some reason decided to go to the other set of doors to open them first which felt very rude and in polite. I asked for some Tabasco sauce. The guy walked away and never returned. I asked another staff member for some Tabasco who promptly returned with a different brand of hot sauce showing just how slack the service is here. The corned beef hash that we ordered was greasy and hard to chew and the eggs were not cooked as requested. They also forgot extra items that we ordered. Just a complete shambles all round."

We were directed to a table that hadn’t been cleaned, and when we pointed it out, he didn’t respond well. Unfortunately, the food didn’t make up for it — the Eggs Benedict were overcooked and lacked flavor.\n\nHis ( host) attitude completely ruined our day in the morning itself.

But before he helped us, his two female colleagues simply ignored us. It’s not very pleasant to see them deliberately avoid eye contact and the calls from my family, just one meter from our table.\nThe kind gentleman served us and even got scolded by one of the women, which I didn’t really understand, given that he was the only one running around and actually taking care of us. 😅"

Serves plenty of business-goers for breakfast before they begin the day around the buildings and also those looking for a quick shot of coffee. We had breakfast here and in particular the eggs set - was well done overall though nothing too fantastic I would say. Very American style and a good decent one at a pretty reasonable price. Alfresco dining also available. It can get pretty noisy indoors as well due to the morning crowd. Located within Grand Central Terminal and very visible once you exist via 42nd Street. Heard their waffles are great too; will be back to try in the future and maybe for lunch!"

They brought us breakfast menu and then we realized there is also a brunch menu and asked for it. It took forever until the brunch menu showed up. we were there around noon. I don’t know why they didn’t bring the brunch menu in the first place, I also asked for the lunch menu which never showed up on the table. I asked for the steak to be medium rare however, it came well done. I’ll give it another try next time since everybody talk good but as of now it’s 2.5 out of five for me by the way they also made mistake with our drinks. My bloody Mary went to my friend and her tomato juice came to me."

Conveniently located across from Grand Central Station, I find myself stopping in not just when I have a train to catch, but whenever I’m in the area. The menu may be limited, but I see that as a focus on quality over quantity. They always have a great wine selection, and the service is consistently attentive. Sure, I could go to ‘fancier’ places, but what keeps me coming back is the welcoming staff, the excellent food, and the attention to detail that Pershing Square is known for. I truly hope they’re around for as long as I am."

But recently, I’ve had a very bad experience. Ordered a medium- rare steak, but the meat is very tough and very difficult to cut. Moreover, I forgot the Airpod at the store and called back and forth to get a rude and disrespectful answer. That don’t have not here. Why didn‘t you treat it? And I myself opened the GPS location and found that the staff in the store was the one who took it. In addition, the answer I got was from the Host and manager. I will not forget this experience."
