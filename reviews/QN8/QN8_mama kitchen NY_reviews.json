The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the food—wow, the food is absolutely incredible.\nI ordered the chicken shawarma platter, and it was bursting with flavor. The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender, the hummus was creamy and rich, and the fresh pita was the perfect complement. Every bite tasted homemade, like something passed down through generations.\nWhat really stood out was the hospitality. The staff was so kind and attentive, making sure everything was just right. You can tell they genuinely care about their customers and take pride in serving authentic, high-quality food.\nIf you're looking for delicious Mediterranean comfort food in NYC, Mama Kitchen is a must-visit. I left full, happy, and already planning my next meal there. Highly recommend!"

From the moment you walk in, you're greeted with warm hospitality and the incredible aroma of spices that instantly transports you to the streets of Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.\nThe food? Absolutely phenomenal. I tried the cauliflower shawarma on frena bread, the eggplant carpaccio, and their signature hummus plate—each dish was bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. You can tell everything is made with love and authenticity. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with a modern Middle Eastern vibe that makes you want to stay and savor every bite.\nIf you're in Queens and craving top-tier kosher Middle Eastern cuisine, Mama Kitchen is a must-visit. Whether you're a local or just passing through, this place is a gem that deserves all the praise!"

The fish balls were very smelly and tasted funny that I threw it away.\nTo sum it up, very expensive and not worth the price..I am all down for helping small businesses in our community but this was like a rip off to me. Better off getting from muscat or grill point"

It has some unusual and very interesting dishes on its menu, several of which I have never heard of before.\nWe have eaten at the restaurant twice and gotten take out twice. They do takeout only on Friday and do not do takeout the rest of the week. . Service is ok, but dishes sometimes take a while to come out from the kitchen, presumably because everything is made to order. Give yourself some extra time on Friday, because it takes the staff a bit of time to explain dishes to people.\nThis is our new favorite restaurant on Main Street and is highly recommended"

The patty was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful sweet flavor that made it stand out from other burger I've had. The toppings were also fresh and tasty, and the bun was toasted to perfection. I highly recommend trying the burger if you're a burger lover like me!"
