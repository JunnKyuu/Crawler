Tables were still empty with one or two customers but that was the best thing quite calm and satisfying super . My first time and hope to go back. It somehow   too pricy , $40.00 for  a cut of Salmon or $25.00 for a dish of pasta  But we enjoyed it very much or maybe we were hungry after a day of graduation ceremonies. Well worth it in comparison to service of other restaurants in the same neighborhood hopefully see you soon . The food was very delicious.the only disappointment they don’t or didn’t serve us any bread or butter as if the forgot?"

So fun and lively!\nWe ordered:\n\n1) Porcini Arancini = It was absolutely delicious and flavorful! My favorite! Mushroom, risotto and truffle. The best Trio combination you can get!\n2) Arugula and Baked Feta =  Everything paired really well together! The feta went well with the pear. Never saw that going together but pleasantly surprised. Only thing I would say is the plating could be better. You can make it a lot nicer with the baked feta and pears than laying it on the side of the salad.\n\n3) Shoshito Peppers = As my wife says every time I bring them up she says \"Yummy\". It was also a lot of fun. My wife hates spicy foods and I love spicy! We both would eat one and see who ate a spicy one.\n\nThen we go to the main course!\n\n4) Wild Halibut = When we got this dish, the halibut was tasty mouthwatering! When I cut into the fish you can see a beautiful and glistening white inside! However, I would have rested the peppers on top rather than have it hiding under the fish.\n\n5) Wild Mushroom Pappardelle = Small serving size but tasteful! The plating of the pasta was very nice! I do feel there was something missing that can really bring out this dish to its potential. But they most certainly did not skip on the mushroom portions!!\n\n6) We had to get there dessert special which was the cinnamon roll. WOW! I mean... WOW! It was Incredible! I tried stopping myself from eating it as I am on a diet, but we finished the whole thing. It was sweet and savory. The nuts on top are a great addition! WOW!\n\n7) tiramisu cake = Was not a fan of it. I did not understand why they put Cherries on top of it. I also did not like how it was in a dish. The whip cream was dense and the cake itself was bitter. When we brought it to the managers attention he was very nice and was open to feedback.\n\nThe Waitresses there were so nice and always looking our way to see if we ever needed anything. They Recommended really good food as you can see! They were never rude and always polite!\n\nOverall my wife an I had an amazing time at Cafe Premiata! We will most definitely be coming back!"
