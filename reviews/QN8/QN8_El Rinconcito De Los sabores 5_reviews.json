The red and green sauces are delicious - not too hot, but very flavorful. I can also verify that the chips and guac are delicious and they offer tasty nopales, and have vegetarian options including beans and mushrooms. Hearty corn quesadillas. I've been very happy with everything I've ordered from here; one day I'll get some friends together to try the Birria Pizza.\n\nThis spot fills the niche of great hole-in-the-wall mexican spots that was missing in Kew Gardens. Well worth the visit if that's what you're looking for."
