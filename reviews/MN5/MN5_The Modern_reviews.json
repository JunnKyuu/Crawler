The richness of flavors is appreciated in every dish but the flavors are all very strong and less coordinative or soothing. Also there were two dessert courses followed by a free offering of chocolate tasting which felt too much for dessert.\n\nThe service was excellent and professional though."

            "text": "This is my second visit—my first was back in 2016.\n\nThe place has stayed much the same: elegant, with that refined MOMA-like atmosphere. What’s changed is me. I no longer get swept up in the presentation; I care more about the actual flavors.\n\nThis time around, I’d say most of the dishes were good, but the main course—steak and lobster—felt lackluster, borderline mediocre. The wine pairing had its moments: a few excellent choices, but some were questionable. Still, for under $200, I can’t complain too much.\n\nWould I return for the Michelin stars alone? Definitely not.\nBut would I come back for a relaxed dinner or a date night? Absolutely."

It's disgusting — men and women share the same space, with only a few small individual stalls (about the size of airplane restrooms) lined up in a row. When you step out, you immediately face someone of the opposite gender using the mirrors, which creates an awkward and confusing situation for everyone. There’s no real privacy, and the setup feels completely inappropriate. Honestly, it was unacceptable."

            "text": "I came up to NYC for the weekend to celebrate my wedding anniversary with my wife, and as part of our tradition, my wife and I try to visit as many Michelin-starred restaurants as we can reasonably fit into our plans. The Modern had been on our list for a while, and I’ll say upfront, this was one of the more difficult places to rate.\nLet’s start with the positives. The space itself is gorgeous! Sleek, modern, and perfectly in line with its name. We had some rain that evening, which dulled the view a bit, but that’s no fault of the restaurant. The food, however, was exceptional. They opened strong with a soup that was rich and balanced, and the courses that followed kept up the momentum (such as their Eggs on Eggs on Eggs picture attached). Each dish was thoughtful, beautifully plated, and full of flavor. It’s clear the kitchen knows what it’s doing.\nService was also excellent. The staff knew it was our anniversary and made a genuine effort to make the evening feel special. They were attentive without hovering, and the pacing of the meal was spot on.\nNow, here’s where things got complicated. Toward the end of our meal, just before dessert, a party of six was seated nearby. Normally, I wouldn’t bat an eye as people come and go, and everyone deserves a great meal. But this group felt completely out of sync with the atmosphere. Two were dressed in suits, two in business casual, and two in jeans and hoodies. Again, I’m not one to judge attire too harshly, but what really threw us was their behavior. They were loud, disruptive, and most surprisingly they started playing cards at the table. In a fine dining setting, that’s just not something you expect or want to navigate while finishing a carefully curated tasting menu.\nWe still had a lovely evening overall, and the food truly was memorable. But I hope future guests get to enjoy The Modern without having to plan around impromptu card games at neighboring tables."

We do have many fine locally \"Hatted\" restaurants in both Australia and New Zealand.\nA few I have sampled\n\nWhile visiting NYC this October, wanted to take the opportunity to sample a few Michelin starred restaurants to compare\n\nWhile the ambience and food are unlike the many fine dinning restaurants I am used to back in Australia / New Zealand, the Modern is a very good different. Local fare, local ingredients\n\nThe Caviar Hot Dogs. Playful, delectable and indulgent in a beautiful bite sized package. Only in America 😀\n\nThe Scollop dish with the beans - very American and showcases Americana wonderfully\n\nThe Hazelnut dessert with the layered chocolate flakes. Also so deliciously American\n\nThe wine pairings were also wonderful and did lift the flavour profiles of each dish\n\nIn all, had a thoroughly delightful and enjoyable evening here. Big shout out to my server Esteban and his colleagues who took great care to look after a solo diner like myself who can usually get lost in a crowd but not at The Modern 😁\n\nI would definitely come back - next time I am in Manhattan again - and highly recommend The Modern for all especially if you are looking for a fun, fresh and contemporary dinning experience"

We chose the impressions menu and the food was beautiful, delicious and each dish was well crafted. Highlights were the crab-avocado first course, squash soup with morels, turbot with lobster bisque and sabayon, heritage chicken and the dessert (ok - so basically all of it :)). We opted for cocktails instead of wine - The Modern was exceptional. And all of it elevated into a wonderful experience by our server, Antu (and all of the staff).

Every course was beautifully composed and nuanced, with unexpected surprises tucked into each dish that delighted the curious mind. As a biochemist, I was particularly pleased by the excitement and willingness of the knowledgeable staff to explain how specific textures and tastes were constructed from a clever mix of simple and complex ingredients. The kampache hit the spot, as did the pumpkin decoction accompanying it with little sesame crunches. The Modern Martini was a masterful blend by a clearly talented bartender. We were seated by the garden and the noise level was perfect - we could chat & catch up over nearly 3 hrs with lots of laughter. A hand written thank you note to the Chef earned us a surprise visit to the Kitchen, which capped off a perfect day in the city. Thanks to the staff for an excellent time. We will definitely be back!"

            "text": "MoMA is my favorite NYC institution, and I've been dying to check out The Modern ever since I learned of its existence, but would you believe that no one ever wants to spend $200+ to experience it with me?\n\nPffft. Plebs.\n\nWell, I finally got my wish when relatives came to visit. We opted for the Impressions menu as it had more of what we wanted.\n\n- Smoked sturgeon and cucumber tart: Perfectly baked, and as savory and refreshing as one would expect for this kind of opener.\n\n- Avocado and summer squash with cara cara orange and basil: Beautifully plated and as refreshing as, well, a summer salad. The cara caras were a nice touch.\n\n- Sunflower sourdough with cultured butter + Turbot cooked on the bone with sweet corn and lovage: These came together, presumably so one had something to sop up the lovely turbot sauce with. The sourdough was crisp and chewy, and the fish was perfectly tender with lots of maize flavor. Lovely.\n\n- Roasted maine lobster with maitakes and meyer lemons vs. Venison glazed in cognac with sweet prince tomatoes and jamon iberico: Half of our party opted for the lobster, while the other half got venison, allowing us to try both. I was Team Lobster and definitely made the right choice, from the juicy, crunchy crustacean itself to the equally juicy, crunchy shrooms. Mmmm. The venison will undoubtedly appease manly red meat lovers, but I'm so over the \"seared meat course\" on every tasting menu.\n\n- Milk chocolate ganache with mint and shiso ice cream: A simple but satisfying dessert with surprisingly not too sweet ganache. The real star was the ice-cream though, because I've rarely found shiso ice-cream anywhere (even in Japan), and considering it's one of my favorite herbs....Let's just say I *MIGHT* have licked my plate. Might.\n\nWe also received a complimentary white chocolate and lemon mini-cake for celebrating a special occasion. It was delectably spongey and large enough for the whole table to share. The final petit fours were a nice touch as well: an mandarin chocolate truffle and guava-jasmine gelatin.\n\nFor drinky drinks, we got the fruity Jungle Bird and zesty Spiced Pina, but their cocktail and wine list will likely impress even the pickiest drinkers, given this is a two Michelin-starred restaurant.\n\nService was as attentive as one would also expect for such a starred restaurant, but not so overly obsequious that I felt like I'd been recently knighted. I actually felt the decor was a bit lacking for a modern art museum restaurant--they could use a few unique statues and paintings a la Robert above the Museum of Arts and Design. And the sculpture park wasn't lit up when we were there, so that was boring to behold too.\n\nAll in all, glad I (finally) tried this. For the most part, it lived up to the fantasies."

The crab appetizer was in a  barely-interesting curry. The octopus and pork belly were so mismatched in texture and flavor that it was almost surprising. The sundae dessert was the opposite of what I asked the server to recommend, which was something with more acidity as a palate cleanser. I could barely eat a third of it because it was so rich--and salty! You can have better versions of the crab, octopus and pork belly at so many other places in New York. The same goes for the dessert, which was more salty than sweet."

The food, atmosphere and service were top excellent.\nOur server Allegra was knowledgeable, fun and on point all evening.\nThe room is airy, modern and beautiful.\nThe food is delicious and beautifully presented.\nThe eggs on eggs on eggs was the highlight. Full of flavour with a unique and pleasing presentation.\nWe enjoyed the 7 course meal with wine pairings. It’s the way to go as adding the eggs on eggs dish is an extra $75 anyway and you have to try it.\nIf you’re in NYC and have a healthy budget The Modern is an excellent option. It definitely stands up to its 2 star Michelin status."

No dish was inherently bad or a “miss”, but it just consistently felt a little short of other 2* quality restaurants I’ve been to.\n\nThe service is phenomenal and the wine pairing was great. But the food itself didn’t quite hit the mark and felt like it was consistently just below expectations for what the quality is typically at for a restaurant of this level. It wasn’t any one thing in particular was is unfortunate. Some dishes it was a lack of seasoning, others it was an over-emphasis of a given ingredient. I think The Modern is close to being great, but needs to perhaps refine the current menu a bit."

From start to finish, the entire experience was great.\n\nThe wine program in particular deserves a spotlight. Jenna, the sommelier (originally from California, if I remember her name correctly I hope), was phenomenal. She didn’t just recommend wines, she took the time to talk through the selections, explain the pairings, and guide us toward wine that complemented our dishes perfectly. Her knowledge was impressive, but what stood out even more was how approachable and genuine she was. Sometimes wine service can feel stiff, but Jenna’s enthusiasm and down-to-earth personality made it fun, engaging, and really added to the evening.\nOur server was just as wonderful, warm, friendly, and attentive without ever being overbearing. She had a natural ease, and it was clear she genuinely cared about making sure we were enjoying ourselves. The supporting wait staff also played a big role in the seamless service, assisting quickly and thoughtfully whenever needed.\n\nAs for the food, every dish was presented nicely and mostly all very flavorful. Each course felt carefully prepared, and when paired with the wines Jenna (really hope this is her name!) suggested, the flavors truly came alive. It’s rare to find a spot where the food, wine, and service are all in harmony, but this restaurant delivered.\n\nWe’re already looking forward to returning and recommend it, whether you’re celebrating something special or just want an evening of good food and wine in a welcoming atmosphere."

            "text": "This was my first time visiting the restaurant, and I reserved a seat for one. The server arranged a very spacious sofa seat by the window, offering a great view of the garden.\n\nI ordered the three course prix fixe menu, with wine pairing. The staff were very friendly and gentle, and the dishes were impressive. The main course,roasted lamb with sour cherries, watercress and eggplant was particularly amazing; even towards the end, the meat remained incredibly tender. The wines paired with the dishes were all very well chosen, especially the Ngeringa Syrah 2022 paired with the lamb, which complemented the cherry and blackberry aromas along with the smoky finish, matching the lamb perfectly.\n\nThe dessert was roasted peaches, cheesecake mousse, and tarragon, paired with Cuvée Thibault Jurançon Moelleux Petit Manseng. Both the dessert and Cuvée Thibault were excellent individually. Drinking the wine on its own allowed me to truly appreciate its flavor, but unfortunately, the sweetness of both the dessert and the wine paired well at first, but as the sweetness built up, it became hard to discern the evolving flavors of the dessert or the wine. I believe if this dessert were paired with a high-mountain tea from Asia, it would have had a more distinct expression.\n\nAnother disappointment was that, to balance the sweetness of the wine and dessert, I ordered a pot of Darjeeling tea. Unfortunately, this cup of tea didn’t seem to meet the standards one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The tea had a very faint aroma and was bitter from the very first sip, becoming even more unpleasant and difficult to drink towards the end.\n\nHowever, overall, it’s still a restaurant well worth visiting, and I hope to return next time to try different flavors in another season.\n\n這次點的是三道菜的套餐，另外搭配Wine Pairing。\n服務人員非常友善溫和，餐點也令人驚艷，尤其是主餐的羊排，即便吃到後面仍非常軟嫩。配餐的酒都選得非常合適，尤其是搭配主餐的Ngeringa Syrah 2022, 櫻桃黑莓的香氣和後面的煙熏香，和羊排相得益彰。\n甜點是roasted peaches, cheesecake mousse and tarragon搭配Cuvée Thibault Jurançon Moelleux Petit Manseng, 甜點與Cuvée Thibault 單獨的比現都非常棒，單喝酒可以很好的感受到這款酒的風味，但有點可惜兩者的甜味搭配第一口很好，但後面就會因為甜味疊加的關係，無法細細品嘗到甜點或酒的滋味變化，如果這款甜點，搭配亞洲的茶高山茶，相信會有更突出的表現。\n另外非常可惜的是，為了中和酒和甜點的甜味，我點了一壺大吉嶺，但這杯茶似乎沒有這家餐廳該有的水準，茶香非常淡，且從第一杯開始就非常的苦澀，到後面更是難以入喉。"
