Staff was very friendly.  Seated next to us was a man from Australia who needed directions & the manager/owner (???) not only gave him verbal directions but printed out which bus transfers he would need-so friendly & helpful.  Great place to eat and great staff."

I did not appreciate the substitution without asking me first.  She also said they were not serving decaf coffee because it was after a certain hour.  A ridiculous rule if true.  Do right by the paying customer (which by the way it is nyc prices so it ended up being a very pricey omelette since i did not eat the french fries) specially for simple requests.  Food was just so-so.  I don't think waitress was on her game and it was not even busy at the time.  I can't recommend and certainly will not be back."

As I’m cutting and eating there’s a strange texture and it white bread so I have even less of the cold cuts type fried meat. Bland broccoli and lumpy but somewhat flavorful mashed potatoes.\nI ordered a ginger ale, they were hot, I asked for a cup of ice to go. They were going to charge me for the cup of ice.

Friendliness and kindness are the order of the day.\nWhat a pleasure to savor the dishes at Andrews, we went there because it was highly rated, and I must admit I've been there several times and never been disappointed so far, and I'm counting on them not to."

            "text": "Stepping into Andrew NYC Diner feels like time-traveling straight into the heart of classic New York—but with a cozy, neighborhood twist that makes you feel instantly at home. Nestled on a bustling corner, the neon sign glows like a beacon for locals, night owls, and food lovers alike. The moment you walk in, you’re hit with the comforting aroma of sizzling bacon, fresh coffee, and something sweet baking in the back. It’s a sensory welcome that says, you’re in the right place.\n\nThe booths are plush, and the menu—oh, the menu—is a love letter to diner culture. I ordered the Andrew’s Special Burger, piled high with crispy onion rings and a smoky house sauce that I swear could fix a bad day. And let’s talk about the pancakes: fluffy, golden, with edges just crisp enough to hold the butter like a secret. One bite and I was a kid again, grinning with syrup on my face. What truly sets Andrew NYC Diner apart isn’t just the food—it’s the vibe. I didn’t just eat there—I felt part of something timeless. And as soon as I stepped out onto the sidewalk, I knew I’d be back. Probably sooner than later."

Desde que llegué nadie se acercó para preguntar nada, solo era yo pero se preocupaban por atender grupos grandes!!

De todo lo que quería comer, terminé con otra cosa que fuese más rápido para ellos porque si así como me atendieron, sería la comida …. En fin… un lugar que yo no volvería…"

I had the Breakfast Sampler, and it did not disappoint.\n\nThe only downside was that our server looked extremely tired and seemed eager to get us out as quickly as possible. I get that it was early, and maybe they had a long night before, but it was a bit of a shame considering how great everything else was.\n\nThat said, the food and overall experience were definitely worth it. A solid recommendation for other tourists looking for a proper American breakfast!"
