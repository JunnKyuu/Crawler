Once I went to pay, she forced me to leave a tip of 20/22/ or 25% and she made me feel super uncomfortable and upset to be honest. She said that \"We work for tips only and these are your options to choose from\" while there is other options such as custom/no tip options.  I am super disappointed and most likely will not be going back. I have never in my life had a waitress tell me I HAVE TO tip. (Was going to leave a tip, but she forced a bigger percentage). Would not recommend although the food was good."

Leslie R. helped me out and was very kind.  I told her what I was interested in and she went up to the kitchen to check with the chef if either option (chicken soup and chicken fingers) were safe for me.  She came down and let me know both were safe so I ordered both.  Yes, it’s 92* in July  🥵 but I am SO glad I ordered the soup.  It is LOADED with tender chicken, celery, onions, carrots, and small noodles.\nI will definitely be visiting this place before we head home. I want to mention again how kind and welcoming Leslie was.  She offered me to sit and a glass of water while I waited.\nI haven’t broken into the chicken fingers yet but they look delicious!

But once inside this nice size diner, one realizes that the place is attractive (see my photos).\nUPDATED REVIEW:\nAt one o'clock in the afternoon, I ordered from the area of the menu which says, \" breakfast all day.\"  I had three scrambled eggs, small cubed home fries, ham and challah bread. Jelly and Greenland salted butter came on the side with the order. They have a new chef whose home fries I did not care for. Instead of putting bread on a plate of its own, they put the bread on the plate with the eggs, thereby giving you a SMALL amount of home fries or its alternative French fries. The cost was, including tax, $24 + tip. It was the optional ham cost that brought the price to that level. They offer the eggs with an option to add Nova smoked salmon on the side, as was the ham. I had their coffee and enjoyed it. After leaving the above review about the eggs, I went back and had their oatmeal which was watery. It had a lot of fruit on it, but the preparation of the oatmeal, which should not be watery, was poor. My photos include the restaurant's framed image of the Brooklyn Dodger's Ebbets Field stadium and a flag landmark seen near the restaurant. I have included in my photos a number of different areas of the diner, including the bar where you can order from the menu being served at the tables."

The prices are fine for the area, the food is delicious and generous, the service is fast and the design makes you feel like you are in an American movie. Special thanks to our waiter Cheikh for being so friendly and welcoming, his professionalism makes us want to come back. And we will! Thank you so much Cheikh!"

            "text": "We were going to eat at an Italian restaurant nearby but there was a 45 minute wait. There was no wait at the Brooklyn Diner so we gave it a try. We are glad we did. The restaurant is more upscale than a typical diner but the atmosphere is very relaxed. The staff is friendly and our server did an excellent job. She answered our questions and checked on us enough, but not too much.  The food was delicious. I had a basic cheeseburger but it was cooked perfectly and the toppings were as fresh as could be. A table next to us had the chicken pot pie - it looked amazing. A wide ranging menu that has something for everyone. The food arrived quickly and the meal went smoothly. We liked it so much we stopped in after a play the next night. Great service, nice atmosphere, no wait and delicious food. All at a reasonable price. A rarity for New York. If you are in the Times Square area and looking for a good restaurant, you should give the Brooklyn Diner a look."

We were seated right away, and our food arrived quickly. One bite was enough to make my day! I got the BBQ burger, and my boyfriend had the popular hot pastrami sandwich, both were amazing. On top of that, the staff was super attentive and friendly. Highly recommend!"

She was warm, attentive, and made us feel welcome without ever rushing us. Every recommendation she gave was spot-on, and you could tell she genuinely cared about making sure we enjoyed ourselves.\n\nThe food was just as impressive. Everything came out fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. It’s rare to find a place in such a busy part of the city that feels both lively and comfortable, but Brooklyn Diner pulls it off.\n\nA special thank-you to Gabriella for going above and beyond—she turned a good meal into a great night."
