The service is attentive and welcoming without ever feeling rushed, which makes the dining experience even more special.\n\nThe food is exceptional — fresh ingredients, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. The pasta is perfectly cooked, the seafood is fresh, and the sauces are rich and balanced. Every dish feels like it was made with care. The wine list is also impressive, with options that pair wonderfully with the menu.\n\nFor dessert, I highly recommend trying the tiramisu — light, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness.\n\nWhether you’re coming for a romantic dinner, a family celebration, or a night out with friends, La Masserie delivers an unforgettable experience. It’s the kind of place you’ll want to return to again and again."

A complimentary bread basket comes with a small dish of lentils, bread, and bread sticks which are delicious. I tried their salmon with mustard sauce ($39.50), ordered medium. It was served that way, it was moist and I enjoyed it. On another visit there I had their Chicken Paesano. The chicken pieces were not tender. On another visit there I tried their rabbit that came with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The rabbit ($49.50) had lost a lot of its flavor due to its preparation. The mashed potatoes were very enjoyable, the Brussels sprouts were good. A thin electric candle ads a nice touch to each table. They serve the same menu for lunch and dinner."

Then, when the restaurant called to confirm my reservation, they confirmed with me that it was for a birthday. When we got to dinner, we heard the staff sing happy birthday to two separate tables, so we were looking forward to that when we ordered dessert. The dessert came and happy birthday was not sung to the table. No mention of a birthday at all. Just not sure why I was asked multiple times if it was a birthday if the host/manager who sat us was not going to inform the waitstaff. Not only that, but we ordered tiramisu thinking it’d be wonderful at an authentic Italian restaurant and it was pretty disappointing in comparison to the rest of the meal. Overall, a very disappointing end to an otherwise good birthday dinner."

My son and I had lunch at La Masseria on 48th before our show, and everything from the food to the service was absolutely top-notch.

When we got to the theatre, they wouldn’t allow any food inside even sealed. I rushed back and asked if the restaurant could hold it for us until after the show, and without hesitation, the manager said, “Of course.” That simple act truly blew me away.\n\nIn all my dining experiences, I’ve rarely encountered this level of first-class customer service. I’m so glad we made a last-minute decision to dine here. A huge thank-you to the host, our servers, and the manager( on the 3pm shift, mi dispiace for not getting your names...), you’ve absolutely earned a customer for life!

The place was packed with the pre-theater matinee diners (and probably extra busy because its the holiday season) and was buzzing. The service is spectacular. They have a well oiled machine and know exactly what they're doing to make sure nothing goes wrong. I was so impressed watching all the staff whiz around the restaurant.\n\nThey start you off with a complimentary bread basket. We started with 3 appetizers - the burrata special, mozzarella farcita dello chef (homemade fresh mozzarella cheese stuffed with sweet roast peppers & marinated eggplant, served with fresh tomatoes & basil) and the calamari. Everything was excellent. Plenty of food for us 6 and still had leftovers.\n\nFor an entrees I had the agnolotti piemontesi - homemade veal & parmesan cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms sauce. Devine! A must. My colleagues raved about their homemade potato gnocchi with radicchio & taleggio cheese sauce which also looked so great. Cocktails all around were wonderful. Ordered a few desserts - tiramisu was a standout!\n\nIf you are looking for a great place to eat this holiday season with family and friends add this to your list. You wont be disappointed!"

We got 2 of those meals that they make themselves. We did not get anything besides main course. The waiter wasn’t very friendly. Atmosphere was beautiful, calm, romantic. Decorated for beautifully for Christmas as well!"

            "text": "great spot for a proper date. we were recommended this spot by our hotel concierge for an authentic italian w cozy vibes/not try-too-hard and it delivered. the staff were funny and friendly yet extremely professional.\nunfortunately, to my regret, we didn't get to try their pasta as it was super late when we got there (and who eats carbs at 11 PM? [the italian inside of u is screaming at me en, SIA])\n, so we settled for a salad w a side of grilled chicken and an actual chicken w a side of a potato/beans/tomato which could have used salt or more seasoning but the chicken itself was perfectly cooked.\noverall it's a grown ups restaurant, proper for introductory dates and great food. will definitely be back to try their pasta this time.\n\noh, almost forgot, the tiramisu was great. it was more of a tiramisu cake, i would've liked a bit more of a coffee dip on the base but i guess bc it was a cake they can't leave it in espresso to absorb the flavour as long as lady fingers. anywho, didn't take away from the overall amazing flavour. thanks la masseria server who reminded us to try it."

The staff was 5 stars!! Super friendly! The balcony overlooking the restaurant is super cute. Tried the fettuccine with veal and mushrooms! One of the best dishes of my life! BlackBerry whiskey cocktail was also great!! Just an FYI, if you order still water, they charge you $10 for the bottle…"

They happened to have a saffron risotto special on the night I went and it was out of this world. Their limoncello martini is also phenomenal. The atmosphere is lovely, staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and location is convenient for seeing a Broadway show. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone I know. Can't wait to come back!"

            "text": "My husband and I met my cousins here at 7pm on 24th February, to celebrate my 60th birthday.\n\nUpon arrival, we found it to be very busy and noisy. I say noisy as I am deaf and wear hearing aids. Once I adjusted them to the surroundings, it was easier to cope with.\n\nThis is \"the\" place to come to for your \"pre theatre dinner\" as situated within the Broadway/Times Square area of New York.\n\nEvery table was filled, including those behind us, upstairs on the balcony. There was a constant flurry of activity around us, yet, did not seem overcrowded.\n\nWe had 2 different waiters who were \"very\" attentive. Refilling our water glasses often.\n\nAs we couldn't decide which starter to have, our host, my cousin, ordered the buratta caprese salad, bread basket and capers for the 4 of us.\n\nI would also like to point out, no pizza are on the menu.\n\nThis was delicious. I'm not a fan of capers but I have to say, I would definitely have this again.\n\nFor the mains, my husband had the beef bolognase. My cousin had pasta with beef, his wife also had something similar and I had the rabbit ear pasta with Italian sausage. Photo with review.\n\nI have \"never\" tasted anything like it. It was flavoursome without being \"too much\" if that makes sense?\n\nMy husband is a very picky eater and I have to admit, was on tenderhooks as to whether he was going to be able to eat anything, actually came out of his comfort zone and tried new dishes. So for that alone, I'm delighted.\n\nWould we go back?\n\n100% YES!!!\n\nI would like to thank everyone for a wonderful unforgettable evening, celebrating my 60th birthday.\n\nThis was our 2nd time in New York. My second time \"home\"! I was born in Manhattan and raised in Scotland. This, our second visit coincided with my \"meeting\" my sister's, for the 1st time, having found them through Ancestry.\n\nAll in all, a dream come true."

            "text": "We made reservations weeks in advance. We were seated right away and offered to check our coats. They also confirmed if we were seeing a show and at what time, which was nice so they could ensure we left in time for our show.\n\nService was excellent, very attentive and the food was delicious. I recommend the mozzarella/eggplant appetizer, roasted red peppers wrapped in fresh mozzarella on top of thinly sliced smoked eggplant, fished with Olive oil and fresh basil. My salmon entree was perfectly cooked. For Dessert some of us had tiramisu and others had the sorbet, both good.\n\nCoincidentally it was restaurant week so the 3 courses only cost us $45/pp. Only thing is They did not offer this menu, we had to ask. So my guess is if you didn't know, you'd miss out. The drinks were around $18 per cocktail but skillfully crafted and packed a punch that justifies the price Imo. One thing that was not so great is that there are only 2 single bathrooms.\n\nOverall, good food and cute decor. We will be back."

We were astounded by the exceptional quality of the food.\n\nLet me provide some context for my experience today. As someone who travels extensively, particularly within the USA due to work, I have had the opportunity to dine in some of the finest restaurants across the country.\n\nI can confidently say that the Scialatielli with wild mushrooms sauce that I had at La Masseria ranks among the top three pastas I've ever had in the USA.\n\nThe presentation was understated yet elegant, the portion size was just right, and the taste was absolutely phenomenal—perfectly al dente with a subtly creamy mushroom sauce.\n\nThe wine and port selection, along with the recommendations from our server, Pascuale, were impeccable.\n\nThe ambiance was beautiful and cozy, with a delightful playlist softly playing in the background, making conversation easy.\n\nTo top it off, the volcano dessert was simply delicious.\n\n100% Recommended"

Qui abbiamo trovato quello che manca in molti ristoranti a NY, cioè un locale pulito, molto curato, con una mise en place idonea, doppia tovaglia, e soprattutto cura del cliente, con camerieri molto cortesi e simpatici che ci hanno coccolato per tutto il tempo. Il cibo veramente ottimo, italiano senza troppe alterazioni."
