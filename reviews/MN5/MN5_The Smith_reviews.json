Recently, on two occasions I tried their dinner which was also up to par. I had the steak (butcher’s cut), fries and spinach which was delicious.\nOur most recent server Charlie was great and naturally lively and thorough which set the tone for the evening. Can’t wait to come back to try more dinner options."

The service, food, and drinks were all fantastic — everything ran so smoothly from start to finish.\nWhen we first moved to the city in 2013, we lived right around the corner, and The Smith quickly became our go-to brunch spot. It only felt right to bring our friends and family to a place that’s always been so special to us.\nThe team was incredibly accommodating, allowing us to bring our own decorations, dessert, and music, and they made sure everything came together perfectly. I can’t recommend The Smith enough and would absolutely host another event here!"

We also had Pool Party Slushie on the side and it was so so good!"

We come here all the time, to multiple of the locations but this is our usual spot and we have a always have a nice dinner but this time, it literally was like the chef put their WHOLE HEART into our meal. i had the vodka pasta and added steak and my boyfriend got the Rib eye and the food was to die for. i always have the vodka pasta too but this time the sauce was just absolutely incredible. i wanted to lick my plate so bad haha! whoever the chef was yesterday needs to be there everyday because WOW. the food and service was just so good i needed to leave a review this time!"

            "text": "Writing to warn anyone doing takeout to look at your order before you leave the restaurant. We often eat at the Smith since it's close to my daughter's apartment and occasionally order takeout salads. Yesterday, my husband ordered three of the kale and quinoa salads which run $28 and $31 for chicken or salmon. We ordered one with salmon and two with double chicken for extra protein, so the two with chicken were $38 EACH! We knew that going in, but when we got the salads home, the amount of actual salad was shocking. It was a fraction of what we get when eating in the restaurant. This in not how it has always been. Especially when we order from the non Midtown location (this is a common takeout order for us). It was honestly so disappointing that someone could box that up, and send off that puny salad in good conscience, knowing the prices there.  There should be some portion control if you're paying the same as if eating in house. We are currently looking for new takeout options in the area to replace this staple. Be warned. The salad that would usually fill this container is only half full. There wasn't even enough kale with the chicken to have kale in every bite. This was over $100 for three salads."

I have been eating at the NYC locations for many years.\nThe atmosphere is great, service is always friendly, the menu is large, and the food and drinks are great, especially the burger.\nThe Smith Midtown (and NoMad) is a great spot for a good meal at any time of the day or night, or drinks at the bar."

The food wasn't bad but not stellar, and service was fine for such a busy spot. Overall, I don't think I'd go back."
