We were very much looking forward an adult evening out, as we had received great service from the bar the prior couple of evenings. Shortly after being seated we wound up next to two obnoxious children with very minimal parental control, there was another child yelling, which their parents found amusing, and another table with a loud child. For a nice hotel, and restaurant, possibly considering a hard cutoff for children would be nice to avoid a spoiled meal over loud children.   Table service was ok, would have liked it to be more elevated."

My issue is that another person just walked in and sat down next to me and the bartender turns to her and ask her what she wants, even though I have been sitting there, and he saw me sitting there and saw this young woman walk in. So I got up and I walked out. The restaurant and the food are expensive and it’s designed to have a great atmosphere, but that is really disheartening when you were waiting to be serviced and somebody just completely ignores you to talk to somebody else and service another client who had just walked in. Thank you so much."

Andrea was so organized and available helping to develop my plan and reserve the space, the serving team went above and beyond throughout the entire luncheon to keep us on schedule, providing everything we needed, and the lead coordinator Mensa could not have been more attentive, kind and responsive, anticipating anything we needed.  The space is just beautiful, food absolutely delicious and the location, perfect.  I would highly recommend hosting any size of event at JAMS.  You all were wonderful, and my guests loved every minute and morsel!"

But the host was so warm and welcoming that I decided to stay for a drink, and I’m so glad I did.\n\n🍸 The Drink\nI ordered The Greenhouse (about $25), and I can honestly say it was the best cocktail I’ve ever had in my entire life. Worth every penny. Balanced, vibrant, and crafted with such care — the kind of drink that sticks with you long after the last sip.\n\n🍴 The Food & Atmosphere\nAlthough I only stayed for one cocktail, the food menu looked incredible — everything passing by to other tables made me want to come back just to eat. The space has a chic, stylish vibe, yet it still feels approachable.\n\n🤝 The Service\nFrom the moment I walked in, the staff made me feel comfortable and cared for, even though I hadn’t planned to stay. The service felt personal and genuine — something you don’t find everywhere in NYC.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nJams truly lives up to the hype. Between the welcoming staff, the atmosphere, and that unforgettable cocktail, I’ll definitely be returning. Highly recommend."

However, for a higher-end hotel, the food itself is pretty average.\n\nThat said, their menu is quite unique - we opted for the vegan peanut butter oatmeal, botanical breakfast and side of chicken sausage. Truly, their peanut butter chocolate oatmeal is absolutely TO DIE FOR—rich, comforting, and worth a return visit just for that alone. Everything else was decent but nothing particularly standout.\n\nSince table space in NYC is quite limited, we opted to sit at the bar, which ended up being a great choice. The bar has a beautiful counter, and the plus side is that you can order food there as well—a nice perk if you prefer a more relaxed experience.\n\nService-wise, our experience was mixed. The host was not friendly or accommodating, coming across as standoffish and uninterested. Fortunately, our server was fantastic—attentive, fast, and kind, which made a huge difference.\n\nOn a super cold east coast morning, stepping into a warm, inviting space for a cozy brunch was exactly what I needed to fuel up for the workday. While the food overall doesn’t necessarily match the upscale setting, the oatmeal alone is enough for me to return."

            "text": "My son and I stopped by here for lunch right after our visit at the MoMa nearby. Jacqueline was our server and we received exceptional service! I appreciate her patience she had with my energetic toddler and her welcoming demeanor. She checked in on us throughout our meal and was very friendly. The food was delicious and will definitely come back for the relaxing vibe and atmosphere. One of the better restaurants I've been to in Midtown. Highly recommend!"

The ambiance was beautiful with its lush greenery and peaceful, zen-like vibe—it didn’t even feel like I was in Manhattan. We were celebrating my step-pop’s birthday, and everything from the food to the service was excellent. I had a burger, my son had the cheeseburger, and I also tried a bit of everything on the table—nothing disappointed. I had a few gin cocktails that were amazing, even if I can’t remember their names! A big thank you to Jackie, who was super attentive and helped us through the menu. I’ll definitely be back."

            "text": "Had an amazing summer salad for lunch, so good came back for an equally amazing dinner with an especially good roast chicken and a peach and plum salad. The cheese plate was much better than most. Service was excellent. Restaurant is full of plants which was very pleasant. Only disappointment was a tasteless tuna crudo which seemed to have none of the seasonings listed in the menu item.\n\nSecond visit the salad was not nearly as good and the chicken was dry and tasteless.\n\nThird visit the salad was terrible and the chicken was only slightly better than the time before. Sadly this will be my last visit"

The atmosphere was vibrant yet cozy, creating the perfect setting for a memorable night. The service was top-notch, with every staff member attentive and welcoming.\n\nOne of the standout moments was when Egypt, the manager, personally came over to check on us. Her personable nature made us feel like VIPs. To our surprise, Chef Carinna also made an appearance at our table to greet us, which added a special touch to the experience.\n\nThe music was another highlight of the evening, with the DJ playing a fantastic mix that set the mood without overpowering the conversation. It added to the overall energy and made the night feel like a true celebration.\n\nOverall, Jams exceeded our expectations in every way, from the warm and personable service to the lively ambiance. I highly recommend it for any special occasion or just a night out with great vibes!"

The cocktails are fresh and delicious, and the food is just as memorable. Returned for dinner with my family and the experience was just as special—warm, candlelit ambiance, perfect service from Sam, and thoughtful recommendations from Jackie, the manager who also shared her love for the plants. Everything was on point. Whether for a full meal or just a drink at the bar, I always recommend Jams and can’t wait to go back."
