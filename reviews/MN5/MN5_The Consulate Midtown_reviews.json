The staff was so attentive and helpful and offered us complimentary champagne for the occasion. We ordered the escargot and oysters to start and they were phenomenal. My husband ordered the short rib cavatelli and I ordered the mushroom gnocchi for dinner. Both were exceptional. We didn’t leave any left over! For dessert we ordered the special (I unfortunately don’t remember the name) but it was delicious. It was similar to a large meringue cookie with cream and fruit. They also surprised us with a complimentary crème brûlée for my birthday. We can’t recommend this restaurant enough!! They are fantastic!"

The oysters tasted like they had been rinsed in tap water - no saltiness or brine, no ocean water. To our waiter’s credit, he took them off the bill.\n\nThe rest of our dinner was also incredibly under-salted. The escargots, the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffles, even the seasonal duck breast. I’ve never before had to ask for salt in a brasserie.\n\nFor good seating, you have to go up a long flight of stairs, which was not possible for our 90 year old mother.\n\nI think they mean well, but it seemed like they really don’t know how to prepare excellent food. I would not recommend for dinner. Probably a nice spot for drinks and some appetizers - there’s a decent zinc bar type situation on the first floor, and also standing tables in the back."

            "text": "The Consulate Midtown is a beautiful restaurant and we were greeted with a smile and kind hostess. We were seated at a quiet upstairs table per my reservation request.\n\nAs far as the service I’m truly torn. Our server was very nice, but seemed she might be new, if not, she should know more about the drinks and menu.\n\nEveryone enjoyed their specialty cocktails. I will add that the Tito’s vodka soda w/a splash of cranberry was $24 +$7 for an extra shot — $31! It didn’t even taste like a double. We know drinks are pricey and are fine with it, but seriously?\n\nAnd then it was time for appetizers. I wanted the Tartare Trio (tuna, salmon, crab), but I don’t eat salmon, so requested to switch it for another of the offerings within the trio, to which I was told “we can not do that.” I did not ask to switch the salmon to lobster tail, so this was very off putting and I decided to forego an appetizer all together (they lost $22 and a star on this review for declining that very easy accommodation).\n\nThe other appetizers a pork rib special and crab cake were all very good.\n\nWhen it came to ordering our entrees we all decided on steak; two filet mignon and two rib-eye. Again I asked to substitute the mashed potatoes for crispy mushrooms (exact same price on the menu) I was told she would have to check with the chef. However, my husband was able to choose any side with his rib-eye, so he ordered the mushrooms and we just swapped.\n\nBoth of the filets were delicious and the crispy mushrooms were fabulous. Unfortunately, my husband and our friend who ordered the rib-eyes medium rare were given medium. Anyone that orders steak and has to send it back knows it’s a kill joy for the meal, so they both said the flavor was decent and they would just eat them.\n\nWe were full and decided to pass on dessert, BUT, our server brought out a Creme Brûlée for our friend’s anniversary. That was extremely kind and appreciated.\n\nAs we were leaving, the same hostess was kind enough to take a few photos of us.\n\nOverall our experience was clearly mixed. The problem is in NYC where there’s so many restaurants to choose from, you really have to hit all the marks. So, we’re not sure if we’d go again."

Great service, attentive and friendly staff. On the food side… getting there. IMO, it lacks finesse both in taste and presentation. What I am about to say, mind you, is all criticism on high-level. For instance, if a cream-based soup is not balanced with acidity you won’t be able to eat more than 3 spoons until your stomach tells you: enough. The celery-apple soup, a long-time favorite in my household, didn’t offer the sweet and tart apple taste it needs to counter the heavy cream. The French onion soup, IMO one of the best ones in midtown, was filled tongue brim the brim and then overflowed when baked. And my goodness, be gentle on the amount of cheese you want to melt..  and then the pasta dish: why add cream to short rib ragout? It makes it look unappealing and is also not necessary for taste. Tasteless good though, but again, the heavy cream will not allow you to eat much. Again, high-level critique and I would return. But a gentle nudge to the chef to keep finessing so the restaurant will earn its place in the most-desired category."

Torianna is a welcoming presence behind the bar, crafting fantastic cocktails, giving great menu recommendations, and adding to the warm atmosphere with her kindness and wit. My favorite dishes are the croque monsieur on Tuesdays, the tuna sandwich on Wednesdays and the avocado and salmon toast on Fridays. In terms of cocktails, the Malalama, Ginger Optional, French 76 and Consulate Old Fashioned are all wonderfully crafted and delicious."

People liked the lobster risotto.\nThings that underwhelmed me: the gnocchi was more generic in flavor It had mostly slightly sautéed button mushrooms and a slight truffle aroma but nothing that carried through into the taste.\nService was fine."

The service was stellar and the dining room on the second floor was beautifully designed.  The tuna sandwich and perfectly cooked fries were equally satisfying.  Look forward to having the excuse to come back for happy hour to try more.  Loved my time here."
