This is absolutely unacceptable.\nI even paid extra for express delivery, yet it still came this late.\nI contacted DoorDash and even called the restaurant, but no one picked up the phone.\nIf you’re going to run your business like this, you might as well not run it at all.\nStop ruining people’s day with such terrible service."

The staff rushed us to pay mid-meal, and after I paid, one of them ran up saying he lost my card - then quite literally vanished. No urgency, no apology, just confusion while they kept serving others. After what felt like forever, they threw my card back without a word. When I finally asked what happened, all I got was, “It was a misunderstanding.” Absolutely unprofessional, careless, and disrespectful."

Just cash or physical cards. 3 of us left our physical corporate cards at the office so we asked if possible to pay by our phones. The guy told us they could so there wasnt a problem at all. The thing is later, when we ask for paying equally by our devices, the guy told us they couldnt make that, just with the physical card is allowed. We got confused why they accept to pay by our devices but not split equally the check. The manager came with the same thing. They split just with the physical but with the devices they do not split but even they didnt allow us to come back with physical as requested from the beggining.\n\nObviously, last time!"

Every plate brought something unique to the table — from the perfectly seasoned fried rice topped with an onsen egg, to the rich and satisfying omusoba drizzled with mayo and okonomiyaki sauce, and the crunchy sushi rolls bursting with freshness and texture. The tempura avocado tacos were a fun and creative twist, and the cheese fries offered a comforting, cheesy bite.\n\nThe restaurant itself had a cozy and welcoming atmosphere, and the staff were attentive — they checked in several times to ensure our food arrived properly and that we were satisfied, which we really appreciated.\n\nHowever, we did find the cheese fries a bit too greasy and heavy, leaving a noticeable oily aftertaste. That was the only dish that didn’t quite meet the high standard of the others.\nAnother small disappointment was being charged $1.50 extra for hot sauce — it was unexpected and felt a bit unnecessary for such a simple request.\n\nDespite these minor issues, the food was overall delicious and savory, and the service was kind and attentive. If not for the extra charge for the hot sauce and the overly oily fries, we’d gladly give them a full 5 stars. Still, this is a place we’d happily return to for another flavorful meal!"

No snooty waitstaff, more of a teamwork sort of effort.\n\nGreat find.\n\nMains came with a delicious spicy tofu appetizer and miso soup.\n\nPork rice with egg - pork was decently tender. Rice was a little stuck together. But overall the parts worked well together: soft onsen egg, crunchy cabbage slivers, pork with sauce and white rice.\n\nOmu soba - very delicious. Not too heavy for fried food. Egg is perfectly soft. Noodles with crunchy cabbage slices were moreish."

Second, food is not great and not as what they show in pictures. Only two thin and small slices of pork in ramen and the skewers combo was not cook from scratch.

We ordered a grilled fish dish that was so good it was gone before the phone could even eat first- I think it was cod, but I’m not sure - it was served in bite size pieces and garnished with a savory & citrusy sauce + plenty of fresh herbs. The okonomiyaki was great as well - if a bit richer than what’s available in Japan. Not that I minded - just a warning that it’s quite filling! The atmosphere was great and reminded me of my travels. The service was attentive to my group and to detail :)"

            "text": "Absolutely delicious! Highly recommend the kimchi cream udon—so rich and flavorful—and the gyu don and zuke salmon donburi, both packed with savory depth. The gyoza and yellowtail carpaccio were also standouts—fresh, well-balanced, and beautifully presented. I’d personally skip the omu soba and hotate carpaccio, which didn’t quite hit the mark for me. Great customer service and a warm, welcoming atmosphere made the experience even better. Will definitely be coming back!"

The prices are very reasonable for the quality you’re getting. The space has a cool, modern vibe with good lighting, and the staff made the whole experience even better with how friendly and attentive they were. I’d definitely recommend checking it out, especially for lunch, their lunch menu is a total win."

Got there a little after they opened up for dinner without a reservation on a weekday and got seated right away. Everyone is super nice and the atmosphere is fun and chill. Their When Bayberry Blooms cocktail is delicious and pretty. Definitely recommend the scallop skewers with uni butter. Absolutely phenomenal and could eat a dozen lol their creamy kimchi udon noodles were surprisingly light and not too heavy as you would expect from a cream based dish. They have a seared salmon nigiri that is pure perfection and melts in your mouth. Will be coming back for sure to try more of their menu.\n\nNow for my standard comments. Location is down some stairs and in a basement area. Do not think I saw a handicap friendly way down there. The interior is clean and well kept. A bit tight but still very comfortable to dine in."

I will visit again until I taste most of the dishes on the menu.\n\nThere are two things that I hope they can improve: 1) too noisy music,  2) sticky table."

I like the teriyaki avocado I got. I came here for the cream udon which was quite good. The only thing is the waiter didn’t ask for my allergy and it turned out it had shrimps in the udon which I am allergic to. He replaced it with a new one without shrimp but it’d have been great if he asked first."

I ordered the fried chicken, kimchi cream udon, and okonomiyaki and everything was really good. The food felt super authentic and full of flavor. The kimchi udon was probably my favorite with that creamy spicy combo. Drinks were tasty too and paired well with the food. It does get busy so a reservation is a good idea if you don’t want to wait. Overall I had a great time here and I’d definitely come back for another round."

Should book in advance, otherwise you’ll need to stand in line, but the good thing is that the line is very quick.\nThen they will seat you, the service is very quick, the food comes momentarily, they try to clean your table asap even if you still have a bite in your plate, so be ready to protect your dish lol.\n\nEven though the service is very brisk and you’re feeling a bit rushed, the food is very good.\nOh, also make sure you’re wearing something light or have a little portable fan with you, because there’s no A/C.\n\nDefinitely would recommend for a quick good food and authentic atmosphere ✨"

The Taki Wasa is raw octopus with a wasabi marinade - it's worth trying, as long as you're comfortable with raw seafood texture (similar to raw scallops), and it pairs very well with the crispy seaweed! The Amakara Ribs were super tender and sweet! The Salmon Don became a go-to for me based on how good it was + you can't beat this price - anywhere else, this dish would've easily costed more."

The wait was over an hour, but once we were seated downstairs, we were greeted warmly and felt right at home.\n\nI went with my fiancé and our son, and we decided to try a variety of dishes since everything was portioned small and perfect for sharing. We ordered the ramen, chicken nanban, kani cream croquettes, and a California roll for our son. Each dish was absolutely delicious.\n\nWe also sampled a couple of their cocktails, which were just as thoughtfully crafted. The vibe of the place was lively but cozy, and the staff was kind and attentive.\nThe wait may be long but it was totally worth it. Highly recommend stopping by if you’re in the area!"

As a devoted fan of Japanese cuisine, I can confidently say that this restaurant offers truly authentic dishes that make me feel as though I’m dining in Tokyo itself. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxed and inviting, providing the perfect setting for a memorable meal.\n\nI would like to extend a special thanks to Sara for accommodating my request to reschedule my reservation. Her exceptional customer service made my experience even more enjoyable. In fact, I was so impressed that I made another reservation before my trip back to my country.\n\nThis place has definitely earned a spot on my list of favorites!"
