We were seated around 2 PM catching up with old friends, and by 3 they dropped a Happy Hour menu on our table — we were thrilled and decided to just keep hanging out.\n\nService was excellent, and the team never rushed us off the table like many Manhattan spots tend to do. Drinks were amazing — definitely try the Mezcal Passion Fruit cocktail, it was delicious. The truffle fries and breakfast burrito were both great choices, and our friends ordered pasta dishes that they really enjoyed as well.\n\nWe sat in the outdoor patio area, which was covered for the summer and comfortably quiet, making it perfect for conversation. Overall, just a really pleasant brunch experience. I’ll definitely be back!"

Food isnt not that bad.\n\n미리 예약을 하고 갔음에도 화장실 입구 바로 앞을 배정 받았습니다. 홀에는 우리가 있는 내내, 그리고 다 먹고 나갈 때까지 빈 자리가 많았어요.\n그리고 뜨거운 커피를 그냥 물 담는 유리컵에 줘서 제대로 손 댈 수 없었습니다. 대체 어느 카페에서 뜨거운 라떼를 유리잔에 주나요? 손잡이도 없는 컵에 말이죠.\n이것이 모두 인종 차별이 아니라면 서비스 퀄리티 자체에 심각한 문제가 있습니다. 어느 쪽이든 갈 의미가 없는 곳입니다."

            "text": "We were in the neighborhood and looking for a brunch place and online reviews said this place was good and the menu looked decent so we decided to check it out.\n\nWe did not make a reservation but were able to put yourself on the waiting list so that is what we did.  When we checked in, we still had to wait about 15 mins so in total the time detailed during the wait was accurate.\n\nOnce seated, we ordered the burger with fries, avocado toast and the mini breakkie which came with eggs, beans toast and hash browns.  The burger was decent but the fries were good, the avocado toast was a good size and had good flavor.   The beans on the brekkie looked like they can from a can but were still good; the eggs and bread were good while the hashbrowns looked premade.  The flavor and quantity of the flavor was good and each was filling.\n\nOverall a good brunch place if you are in the area as the food and ambiance were good"

We got seated all the way in the back where it was less packed and the wait at the table was a little long but they were busy so it’s understandable. Food wise, the shrimp pasta was good! However the two burgers came to us a little cold rather than warm/hot. Fries were crunchy and hot though. Would come back if I pass by here again."

The food will still be delicious though!\n\nDrinks are great, the menu is fantastic. Really something for everyone. The Afagato is really something else. Not sure what kind of ice cream they use but inject it into my veins.\n\nShout-out to Toby and Juan for their excellent service.\n\nFries are seasoned and crispy. Can eat a bucket of those. The kangaroo is good, just know that Kangaroos are like MMA fighters. So lots of muscle, it's a bit of a chew but worth it for the experience of a Roo skewer.\n\nLoved the breakfast roll, such a thick delicious scrambled egg. I didn't expect to struggle to finish it but yet I did.\n\nHalf of our table ordered the burger and all of the plates were clear. Definitely a winner.\n\nCocktails. All of them. That is all.\n\nCrikey, what a place."

We only saw our server when we ordered and received our food - never once in between, which seems odd compared to other reviews where people raved about the service. The fries for all 4 of us were also drenched in oil as shown in picture, not crispy just soft from oil. The flight tower cocktails were delicious though. The bathroom was shockingly a mess, clearly not checked in on for some time - trash was full even though it was large and a used wet wipe was sitting on the trolley/cart."

I thought it was a problem with the knife until I bit into the sandwich and discovered that the crust was hard and also stuck to your teeth when you bit it.\n\nAs an Australian citizen, I consider it weak to be an Aussie restaurant and not serve proper, crispy fried fish.\n\nSince she was starving, my mother chose to keep the sandwich.\n\nI know that our waiter, who was very nice, informed the management, but they did not have anything to say to us. Our fries were very good and she really liked that the tartar sauce was not overly \"pickly” as she put it.\n\nThe power bowl looked like a hot mess including some spotty looking avocado, but was tasty.\n\nThey do serve a fun looking espresso Martini flight that I spied on somebody else's table with three different versions of it."

Premièrement, très peu de choix (4 ou 5) qui ne permette pas d’adressser les goûts de tous.\n\nNous avons pris 2 plats à partager. Le premier, un plat avec des champignons sautés : je n’ai vraiment pas aimé. Les champignons étaient vinaigrés, et sans sel, le plat était débalancé avec un minuscule œuf au milieu. Puis, à ce prix on s’attend à des champignons sauvages ou autres, mais ce n’étais que des champignons blancs. Déception!\n\nPour le plat de gaufre: contrairement à ce que la serveuse nous a dit il s’agissait de deux minuscules gaufres. Elles ne sont pas faites maison, donc il s’agit des gaufres hyper sucré qu’on achète au supermarché qu’il ne font que réchauffer!!!

It would be great if they included a side salad or some fruit as you only get one piece of toast for the $20. plate. The tea was served piping hot which is always a good thing.\nService is attentive and friendly. The menu is hilarious. For fans of Hole in The Wall, Isla & Co. feels both familiar and new."

We were able to have a longer fun time on a Sunday brunch. The martini flight that was super tasty. The mushroom toast was particularly tasty, it goes really well with avocado."

Love the aussie pride, they have lots of fun facts and cute reading material within their menus and Traditional australian offerings like Kangaroo and Vegimite... lmao Ive eaten here twice and its always good food, good drinks and reliable service. They have an indoor garden area towards the back of the resturaunt and a full coffee bar as well. I had the hicken parm it was HUGE lol, I left with a box that I ate for lunch the next day haha. I'll always recommend this spot to people visiting nyc and I would come back :)\n\nThis is a good spot to bring coworkers, business friends and family visiting from out of town, maybe not a romantic date night.... unless ofcourse you plan on staying in The Hendricks upstairs ;)"

But wow, looks were definitely deceiving. It was so good. I added cheese just because, but honestly, after the first bite, I realized it didn’t even need it. I’d definitely order it again. I also grabbed a Sprite for some bubbles and enjoyed a quiet, peaceful"
