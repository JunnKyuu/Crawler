The lobster bisque was served with a grilled cheese sandwich. the portion was small but complimented the soup serving size. It wasn’t bad but I should have opted for a different starter item.\n\nI ordered the lobster caesar salad as my main dish. The salad had a fair amount of lobster on a bed of salad. The croutons, while tasty, seemed to be layered at the bottom of the salad, causing the illusion of a full salad. I really enjoyed the parmesan crisp added to the salad as it elevated the overall flavor.\n\nIf I return, I might opt for the lobster and prawn burger or the lobster roll."

The service or the food. We had to deal with Lester who clearly didn’t want to be there, didn’t fix our issues, and was just going back and forth aimlessly since there was hardly anyone else to attend to.\n\nThe concept seems good - burgers and lobsters but when you are paying over $40 for one and both are made poorly with ingredients that don’t taste fresh then it becomes a terrible concept.\n\nIf Burger & Lobster changes their staff and replace them with people who actually want to be there as well as make better food that is worth even half the price, then it would make for a far better dining experience."

Over the years we have also sat with Maddie in the dining room and also bar and have had excellent experiences. The food is amazing and service is also excellent, would highly recommend!"

For one that's gross and secondly shellfish allergies.  The waitress took our order and never came back. We were served by one person with no check back and had to eventually ask another waitress for our check. We literally had no other interaction from our waitress after taking the order.\n\nI ordered the beyond burger and it didn't have the fixings on it as described.  I ate it as it was because I didn't want it to get cold. One thing I can say is good job on at least alerting us about the cross contamination factor.  I won't eat there again."

It was first established in London, England and has expanded to various countries around the world.\n\nIn August of 2025, I brought and treated my wife and myself for dinner at the Burger & Lobster Bryant Park, located in Midtown Manhattan, right near Bryant Park. We very much enjoyed our dining experience!!!\n\nThe restaurant’s staff were very kind and welcoming and quickly provided us with a comfortable dining table. Both my wife and I were impressed with the restaurant’s cozy and intimate features, and we definitely enjoyed viewing it’s soaring ceiling and beautiful and distinct artwork. Its elegant and spacious setting, dim lighting, along with the playing of contemporary music helped produce a very casual and relaxed dining atmosphere.\n\nOur server, Marjorie was very friendly and professional and always checked in on us to make sure that we were having a great time. She along with an additional hostess, made sure that our orders were properly noted, provided a great overview on the menu options, and perfectly addressed our menu inquiries. We thank Marjorie and her colleague for their exceptional service and great hospitality!!!\n\nLast, but certainly not least, both my wife and I absolutely loved our meals. We ordered and enjoyed the “Chili Garlic Shrimp” appetizer and the “Burger & Lobster Combo For 2” which consists of a whole lobster, original burger, fries and salad. We found everything to be well cooked, superbly seasoned and delightfully delicious!!!\n\nIf you are fan of burgers and lobster entrees along with receiving great service, then you should definitely visit and dine at the Burger & Lobster Bryant Park!!!"

            "text": "Il posto è incredibilmente bello. Il cibo delizioso! Il negroni lo facciamo meglio noi italiani (secondo me!) ma la birra Brooklyn IPA molto profumata, gradevolmente persistente sul palato. Gli hamburger Wagyu è succoso e da sbranare, ma anche quello tradizionale è insuperabile.\nL’aragosta buona, ma non quanto la carne. Il servizio molto attento, ma ci siamo sentiti cacciati, ci hanno messo molta fretta, ci sparecchiavano mentre stavamo mangiando e quando ancora masticavamo l’ultimo boccone ci hanno portato la carta dei dolci. Tutto molto frettoloso e pressante. Consigliato, soprattutto per la maionese al tartufo, hamburger e dolce!"

After settling down in our hotel we saw Burger & Lobster from our window and we were able to get last minute reservations for 2.\n\nThe vibes of this place was perfect. It was moody but not too dark with a modern industrial look that we both loved. We sat at the bar for a few mins to grab drinks before heading to our table. My boyfriend had the Japanese Smoked Old Fashioned, which he really enjoyed, and I enjoyed my bubbly cocktail though I don't see anything familiar on the current menu.\n\nAs an appetizer, we got the wagyu steak bites which neither of us were super sure about but we really wanted to try. My boyfriend wasn't the biggest fan of the texture but I really enjoyed them and thought they were delicious. For our main dishes, we both got burgers fries and we split a side of mac & cheese. Everything was delicious and very well cooked! We both really enjoyed our food. My boyfriend, a self-proclaimed mac & cheese connoisseur, devoured the mac and stated it was one of the best he's had!\n\nNext time we're in the area I think we'd both enjoy coming back and trying more of the menu."

Got the combo sharing option (1 burger, 1 roll, 1 lobster for 2 people; + salad and fries per person), was a great portion size and tasted great. For what you get and taste it’s reasonable value for money, not an everyday, but one for a special occasion."

When I saw it on the menu i assumed it was 1 salad and fries to share, when our food i saw we both got our own sides i was estatic!\nThe burger was absolutely delicious it had a tangy taste with the pickles and their seed bun really added a nice flavor. The lobster roll bun was buttery and warm, and the lobster dipped in the garlic butter sauce melts in your mouth.\nOur server Jasmine was very kind and welcoming and wasn’t overbearing with her service. Lastly the ambiance here was beautiful the restaurant decor is gorgeous and perfect for date night. 10/10 would recommend this restaurant for locals and tourists"

It can be challenging to accommodate a party this size but everyone received everything asked for and in a timely manner.  Shrimp with avocado appetizer was amazing! We ordered the combo with a london burger and the warm roll.  It was super tasty and the sweet potato fries were so good! See pictures below.  I didn’t mess with the cream sauce but the salad was also delish!  Clean and efficient overall space.  Chill atmosphere and we weren’t rushed at all."

Sharlene, our server, was so kind and welcoming, making us feel right at home. And the food—from the east coast oysters to our lobster rolls with salad, fries, and garlic-butter sauce—each bite was sensational. I’m not trying to be *too* dramatic when I say I had to close my eyes and say a little prayer of gratitude as I savored each bite."

            "text": "Burger & Lobster Bryant Park je známý svou vášní pro jednoduchost a kvalitu. Jeho filozofie vychází z přesvědčení, že méně je někdy více. Místo zbytečných komplikací a přehršle ingrediencí klade důraz na prvotřídní suroviny a jejich dokonalou přípravu.\nV centru pozornosti je čerstvost mořských plodů. Humr je denně čerstvě dovážen z Maine a připravován tak, aby vynikla jeho přirozená sladkost a textura.\n\nPorce jsou velké, jak je zvykem v amerických burgrárnách.\nKrom burgerů jsem ochutnal ústřice, kterou jseou menší než evropské, krabí krokety, humrový mac and cheese, humra a burger.\nRezervaci doporučuji zejména v exponovaných časech a pokud jste skupina větší než čtyři osoby. Jinak obvykle berou hosty přímo z ulice. V nejhorším případě vás posadí ke stolu u baru na drink.\nServis byl takový zmateční. Objednali jsme si lahev růžového vína, místo toho nám přinesl skleničku. Po vysvětlení řekl ať si ji necháme a přinesl lahev. Bohužel, přestože to bylo jeho pochybení, skleničku vína nechal na účtě."
