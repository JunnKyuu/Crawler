I enter the restaurant, look at the menu it was $75 for a steak and $16 for the fries I was appalled by those prices but I got over it as it was a fancy restaurant. I asked for it without the dusting as I'm a picky eater. The food came out, there were mountains of the dusting on it so I was angry my mom didn't let me complain as the people were very nice . I west to the restroom to cool down as I was very angry. So I walk into the stall, I saw a dead cockroach on the floor. In a fancy restaurant I expect much better. The food not being done correctly and the roach on the floor was disgraceful. I would not come back\n• Ever."

I came to Strip House for a friend’s Birthday Dinner and from start to finish, The attention to detail was just astounding.\n\nI was first to arrive in our group and the waitress comes over and she asked me if I would like to drink while I’m waiting so I told her ‘Sure!’. I requested a gin martini with olives, and she informed me that they had a selection of olives to choose from, and that she would highly recommend the truffled blue cheese-stuffed olives.\n\nAfter I finish my martini, she asked me if I would like another and I told her I would like to switch to red wine for my dinner to pair with my steak. Later, while my steak was being prepared, she approached me and said “Your steak is now being prepared. I’d be more than happy to give you my top three selections of wine as they will pair really well with your dinner”.\n\nIt has been a long time since I’ve sat down at a restaurant and heard my waitress pour as much passion and dedication into her job and service as she did with me.\n\nAnd it didn’t end there. The bussers the other wait staff were incredibly kind and gracious, and were very attentive to our needs from the moment we walked in until the moment we left the restaurant. You just don’t see this level of service in restaurants much anymore. I cannot wait to go back!"

As were the gentlemen who bussed the tables and kept our water full (that is a big deal to me).\nWhen I made the reservations I mentioned it was my son’s 10th birthday.  The woman at the front greeted us with warm birthday wishes and took us to our table.\nZack followed suit and made my son feel special and took care of everything we needed.\nThe food was ok.  I ordered the steak medium.  It looked pretty rare.  I don’t like it that way.\nThe sides were good.  The creamed spinach and potatoes (top of the list) were very good.  Plentiful as well.\nMy son hadn’t been to too many nice restaurants. He was dazzled by the lighting and decor.  Of course it didn’t occur to me until we were In front of stills of burlesque dancers why the place was called “Strip House.”  Now I know.\nFinally, we got the famous 24 layer slice of cake.  The top layer is excellent.  My son and I both liked it.  The other 23 layers weren’t great.  Didn’t even finish it at home.\nI want to mention again, they made us feel they knew this was an occasion that mattered.  That really meant a lot to me.  Excellent service."

            "text": "The Strip House (Midtown Location) –\n\nA Perfect Blend of Fine Dining and Game Night Vibes\n\nReturning to The Strip House Midtown felt like visiting an old friend—and once again, they delivered an experience that was nothing short of exceptional. This time, I came with two close friends to catch the Knicks playoff game, and the team at Strip House went above and beyond to make sure we had the best of both worlds: elite-level steakhouse fare and front-row seats to the action.\n\nThey had three seats reserved for us right in front of the TV in the bar area—prime real estate for the game—and it made for the perfect setup. Despite the more casual setting, the attention to detail, service, and food quality never wavered.\n\nWe started things off with a round of cocktails: I had my go-to Old Fashioned, one friend opted for a classic Manhattan, and the other went with a crisp Gin & Tonic. Each drink was expertly prepared and set the tone for the meal.\n\nAppetizers:\n• Strip House Roasted Bacon – Just like last time: thick-cut, smoky, and caramelized to perfection. Still an all-time favorite.\n• Salmon Tartare on Crispy Rice – A fantastic new addition. The salmon was fresh and flavorful, and the crispy rice added a satisfying crunch.\n• Gnocchi Cacio e Pepe with Butter-Poached Lobster – Rich, luxurious, and bursting with flavor. The gnocchi had that ideal pillowy texture, and the lobster elevated the dish to another level.\n\nEntrées:\n• Dry-Aged New York Strip & Dry-Aged Ribeye – Both steaks were absolute showstoppers, perfectly cooked to a juicy medium-rare with that signature Strip House char. Deep, beefy flavor from the dry-aging process made each bite unforgettable.\n\nSides:\n• 1000-Layer Goose Fat Potatoes – Just as incredible as I remembered: crispy, buttery, and dangerously addictive.\n• Kung Pao Brussels Sprouts – A fun, flavorful twist with a nice kick and crunchy texture. A great contrast to the richness of the steaks.\n\nFor the wine, we chose a bottle of Borgogno Nebbiolo \"No Name\"—elegant, earthy, and a beautiful pairing for the bold flavors of our meal. It was a standout.\n\nEven though I didn’t take any photos this time (a rare miss), it was for the best reason—we were too caught up in great conversation, amazing food, and the thrill of watching the Knicks hold their own in a playoff battle that they unfortunately lost. It felt like the kind of night you just soak in rather than document.\n\nDessert:\nWe couldn’t leave without indulging in the Strip House’s iconic desserts.\n\n• Strip House Signature 24-Layer Chocolate Cake – Just as decadent and unforgettable as always. Moist, rich, and layered with pure chocolate bliss.\n\n• New York Cheesecake – A delightful surprise: light, airy, and paired with a heavenly Oreo cookie crust and fresh berries. It struck the perfect balance between creamy and refreshing, and offered a nice contrast to the richness of the cake.\n\nAs always, Chef Larry was in the kitchen and made sure we were well taken care of—his passion for hospitality is palpable and adds so much heart to the experience. Midway through the meal, Sean, who had served us on our last visit, recognized me and came over to say hello, which was a great surprise. While Angela wasn’t on duty, Sophia, the manager that night, stopped by to introduce herself, welcomed us warmly, and generously sent over a round of Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask as an after-dinner treat—a perfect, smooth finish to a stellar evening.\n\nThe service was once again flawless. It was a true team effort with every staff member checking in, topping off water glasses, and making sure we were happy throughout the night without ever feeling interrupted.\n\nThe Strip House continues to deliver a rare combination of luxury dining and genuine hospitality. Whether it’s a special occasion or a game night hangout, they know how to make it memorable. Already looking forward to visit number three."

It was a guys’ night out with some friends I hadn’t seen in a while, so we decided to splurge on an unforgettable dinner. With Chef Larry in the kitchen, we were in for an incredible experience from start to finish.\n\nWe kicked things off with a round of Old Fashioned, expertly crafted with top-notch bourbon, setting the tone for the night. As we moved into appetizers, our waiter Sean—who had an impressive knowledge of wines—helped us select a beautiful Napa Valley Cabernet that paired perfectly with the starters Chef Larry recommended.\n\nAppetizers:\n•\tTuna Tartare w/ Black Tobiko Caviar – Fresh, light, and packed with flavor.\n•\tStrip House Roasted Bacon – Thick, smoky, and perfectly caramelized.\n•\tBufala Burrata w/ Toast – Creamy, rich, and a must-try.\n•\tBrussels Sprouts – Charred to perfection with just the right amount of crunch.\n\nFor the main course, we went all in with the Bone-in KC Strip and DA Ribeye, both cooked to a flawless medium-rare. The steaks had a perfect sear on the outside, a juicy pink center, and were seasoned just right. At Chef Larry’s suggestion, we tried the béarnaise and au poivre sauces—both fantastic additions to the already mouthwatering steaks.\n\nSides to Share:\n•\tLobster Mac & Cheese – Decadent, creamy, and packed with tender lobster.\n•\tBlack Truffle Creamed Spinach – Rich and indulgent, with just the right amount of truffle.\n•\t1000-Layer Goose Fat Potatoes – Crisp, buttery, and utterly addictive.\n•\tCharred Broccoli – A perfectly smoky and flavorful balance to the richer dishes.\n\nSean continued to guide us through the meal, suggesting another exquisite Napa Valley Cabernet to accompany our steaks. His service was exceptional—always there when we needed him but never intrusive.\n\nWhat truly made the night special was the personal touch from Chef Larry, who checked on us multiple times, ensuring everything was just right. He even took a moment to sit with us for a photo and some laughs, making the experience feel personal and memorable.\n\nTo cap off the evening, we indulged in two show-stopping desserts:\n•\tStrip House Signature 24-Layer Chocolate Cake – A rich, chocolate lover’s dream.\n•\tBananas Foster Baked Alaska – A visually stunning, caramelized delight.\n\nJust when we thought the night couldn’t get better, Angela, the Assistant General Manager, stopped by to introduce herself and generously offered us a complimentary after-dinner drink. She poured us a smooth Balvenie Scotch, the perfect way to end an already extraordinary meal.\n\nThis was my first visit to The Strip House, but it certainly won’t be my last. The service was impeccable, the food was phenomenal, and the hospitality exceeded five stars. I can’t wait to go back!"

The interior and atmosphere were very burlesque. The food was delicious and timely - the filet mignon was one of the best steaks I have ever had. I also had the best cocktail I have ever had, called Blowin' Smoke. Our only regret is not having tried the chocolate cake. Very memorable experience - highly recommend!"

The porterhouse was tender, but not very juicy or super rich in its flavour. The menu said that the meat was for two, but it was rather for three.\nThe black truffle creamed spinach was a nice side. I also had their famous chocolate cake. It was very big. Moist. But not the rich chocolate flavour I'd hoped. Some nutty tones."

My fiancé and I came here for our 3rd year anniversary and they made it so special they gave us an anniversary card and the infamous chocolate 24 layer cake! The  steak was very flavorful and tender. The side were a good portion and delicious. The crab cake was very fresh and very little filling .  The pretzel bread was the best bread ever. I would definitely have to recommend this restaurant friends and I would definitely come back when I’m in town."

After looking around the room for our server, the manager noticed and  had to come by to take our order. At that time, she magically appeared and took over. Others had brought out the food, and we saw more of them than her. Good thing the food made up for it!"

Service was attentive and the famous 24 layer chocolate cake. Was very good. Not the best o ever had but for sure worth trying.  Surprising not very rich.  Was a wonderful stop."

            "text": "Updated Review as of Feb 7th Friday dinner, exactly a week after our Girl's Night Out dinner:\n\nMy girl's night the other Friday was so perfect that I had to come back last night for an early Valentines Day dinner and treat my husband. I raved how good everything was last Friday so needless to say, expectations were set pretty high.\n\nFirst off, we arrived like 25 mins. early last night and they seated us immediately. Also gave us the best booth overlooking a glimpse of the action below. Terrence was great, thank you! Buffy immediately greeted me and recognized me from last week and said Alyssa would be taking care of us. Alyssa was INCREDIBLE! Honestly without her super warm and attentive service, this updated review may have been lower than a 4. Alyssa was definitely above 5 out of 5. Thank you so very much, Alyssa. Truly one of the very best we encountered living here in NYC!\n\nStarted off with a glass of Rose Cremant from Alsace while my husband had a 9 oz Argentinian Malbec. Both great. Bread and butter comes and it was yum, thanks for the additional pretzels! We also enjoyed the bacon appetizer, perfect with that honey mustard dip. The French Onion soup arrived but noticeably smaller size and a different bowl/container and not as cheesy and good from last week, that's okay. But the reason wht this isn't a repeat 5-star from last week is because the Wagyu Steak Frites is where it fell flat. My husband's medium preference came out medium rare and my supposedly medium rare felt rare. That and it lacked salt. Like they seemed to have forgotten to put salt. I ordered an au poivre sauce and even with it, it couldnt compensate for it being underseasoned. My husband was trying to get some salt from the pretzels to put in his steak. He specifically asked me to not complain or ask for salt to not offend or be seen as wanting to be comp'd. So I ate 65% and was asked if I wanted it to go and I just said no it's okay. So I'm not sure what happened in the kitchen. I actually felt somehow bad because my husband said, you said it was really good. Oh well. Too bad I couldn't control the consistency in taste and quality of the steak, right. ;)\n\nDesserts came and we were excited for our 12 layer chocolate cakes. But we were pleasantly surprised by the delicious Cheesecake too. We ended up finishing it and taking the chocolate cake slices home. Still tasted divine when we enjoyed it today.\n\nWill emphasize that I'm still a big fan and especially commend the team and the service esp. Alyssa, Buffy, Terrence etc. I just wish the Wagyu steak wasn't a let down last night."

            "text": "Came here for restaurant week because I saw that they were offering steak AND their famous chocolate cake.\n\nSteak itself was alright but the truffle sauce they had was DELICIOUS. The chocolate cake was also perfectly balanced; not too fudgey and not too dry, not too sweet either. I’m glad I came here during restaurant week where they offer three course for $60 because I feel everything is too overpriced otherwise.\n\nService was good. Staff was nice, attentive, and coordinated.\n\nAtmosphere was also quite nice. The place had an early 1900s feel to it and the walls are decorated with photos of old Hollywood stars."

            "text": "We were served steak without steak knives, and the waitress never noticed.\n\nThis was a disappointing experience purely from a service standpoint. Went with a friend for some steak, and a couple things to note about a midtown steakhouse on a weekday 1) there are lots of client dinners occurring in the area and 2) these client dinners are typically middle age men who are going to spend a corporate budget.\n\nAfter a long wait for giving our orders, it was fairly obvious that we were not a priority table (see reason #2 above). We were ok with that! What really changed the tone of dinner was being served steak without the proper knives, and no matter how long we tried to get our waitress’s attention, she never noticed. It was finally a busboy who noticed about 10-15 minutes in that we hadn’t touched our food.\n\nEven weirder, when the check arrived, there is a text line on the receipt that says “a suggested gratuity of 15-20% is customary,” and… the waitress circled the 20? Why? Just why. We were truly lost for explanation on this one, but that was our experience. Food was decent.\n\nEDIT: Adding an update to include that our sauce was forgotten initially as well. And then we were charged for it twice on the bill."
