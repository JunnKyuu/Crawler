For half this price you have better gastronomical experiences easily available in NYC. Based on taste of food alone the place is a 3.5 star absolute and 2 star relative to price and branding. Michelin got this wrong. Yes the service and ambiance etc should help a place get an extra star or two but the food needs to shine before the other aspects add up . Here the food is very good  but just doesn’t deserve to be rated as high as I was sadly led to believe. Not going back."

As a two-star Michelin restaurant, it is worthy of every accolade, and then some.\nThe beautiful, contemporary décor immediately set the tone for an unforgettable evening. The service was immaculate; attentive, warm, and professional in a way that made me feel truly celebrated.\nWe opted for the four-course menu each, which was a culinary journey from start to finish. Every dish was thoughtfully crafted, bursting with flavor, and plated to perfection. The desserts were absolutely delightful, and we couldn’t resist indulging in Gabriel Kreuther’s signature chocolates. They were decadent, silky-smooth, and melted in the mouth with layers of exquisite flavor.\nThis experience was not just another meal at Michelin Restaurant, it was a memory. Thank you, Gabriel Kreuther, for making my milestone birthday truly unique and unforgettable."

We had the regular chefs tasting and ended up chatting with the manager and he took us back to meet everyone in the kitchen! They gave us a little tour and we even took pictures with the crew! It was amazing!!!! And we have been speaking about going back ever since! So I decided to surprise him with reservations for our anniversary in December 2 days before Christmas. It’s a crazy time of year so I wanted to make sure I could get a table. Currently he’s deployed over seas and I thought it would a perfect gift for when he comes back! I emailed about reservations for the chefs table. My initial email I received a reply. I then followed up with 2 more questions and no response! I send a follow up email and still nothing! For such a high end restaurant this is unacceptable customer service. I guess I will spend my $1k+ on one dinner somewhere else. I’m so devastated because I know my husband would have been so happy to go but now out of principle I refuse to ever dine here again.\n\nUpdate…. two months later and still haven’t heard from Paul the head of operations. Absolutely laughable that this is how this establishment treats their customers."

Nous sommes habitués à faire très régulièrement des restaurants étoilés  Michelin et c’est bien la première fois que cela nous arrive. À chaque fois, le chef prend habituellement la peine de modifier le plat.\nBref, on aurait pu dire qu’on allait s’adapter à cela relativement frustrant tout de même,\net attendons la suite avec impatience.\nConcernant les six autres plats :Plein d’erreurs, d’accord de saveurs:  Des plats trop épicés (bass-poisson blanc avec du piment…), parfois insipides (croquette sans saveur) d’autres fois pas assez cuits : les ris de veau !! D’autres avec un goût tellement fort : l’esturgeon était vraiment prédominant et trop fort en bouche\nEt d’autres vraiment sans intérêt: le canard qui avait le goût de fumé et qui avait encore des nerfs à l’intérieur ou encore les coquilles Saint-Jacques, avec aussi un goût de fumé beaucoup trop prononcé … qui ne laissait aucune subtilité aux saveurs, quel dommage !\nMon avis peut sembler dur, mais sincèrement nous avons rarement aussi peu apprécié un repas étoilé et nous ne comprenons pas l’engouement pour cette cuisine.\nLe service était lui aussi très bancal… nous avons dû répéter à plusieurs reprises, que oui, nous souhaitions être débarrassés.\nNous avions également beaucoup de mal à comprendre les explications des plats du au fort accent des serveurs…\nEn revanche, pour nous proposer un extra truffe que nous avons pris à 95 $ par personne,  On a bien été incité à le prendre, et avons vraiment regretté, tant la truffe n’avait que peu de goût..\n\nBref, évidemment, nous ne reviendrons pas et sommes très déçus de cette expérience.\nOn se demande vraiment qui sont les inspecteurs Michelin qui ont accordé deux étoiles à ce restaurant…. Heureusement les autres sont biens mieux!\nPeut-être que le chef était en vacances ? Nous ne saurons pas nous ne l’avons pas vu.\nHeureusement que nous n’avions pas quelque chose à fêter\nNous avons eu le sentiment de nous faire voler car le tout nous aura quand même coûté 1500 $!!\n\nEn bref un seul mot : Dommage"

Gabriel Kreuther has perfected the art of blending German cuisine with French cuisine.\n\nThe atmosphere boasts bold hunter-like elements of the forest (even down to the silverware), perhaps the Black Forest, and combines with the romantic, French countryside.\n\nEach dish is a masterful display of fusion. The flavors and textures don’t compete with one another. They dance.\n\nThe presentation lacks no dramatic effect. Smoke, fire, foam, flower, crystallization, and ice. Every element, every detail comes together as a symphony of flavor.\n\nChef’s kiss 💋\n\n5 stars!"

Yen took care of us that evening and made us feel very welcome the minute we sat down.  He offered recommendations and explained each dish to us.  Every recommended dish was a stand-out. The evening was made even more special when the manager surprised us with a visit to the kitchen to meet the chef—a warm and generous gesture that elevated an already exquisite experience. It was a truly unforgettable way to celebrate my partner’s birthday early, surrounded by elegance and exceptional hospitality."

The food itself is fine. Main dish with the Wagyu and the dessert with chocolate are the highlights, the rest is never a 2 Michelin Star quality.\nThe room itself is average and AC is blowing on your shoulders.\nOverall a very average place, for which I paid 620$/head (service included)\nI do not recommend this place at all, the room and the food can not command such prices."

Our expectation was vastly exceeded both in quality AND quantity of food.\n\nThe woefully meager extent of my food vocabulary (I am a banker with little leasure time) fails me in expressing the palatal bliss I experienced, and it's killing me. From the oyster amuse-bouche and many many food on the way to the Alsatian (probably...) steak entrée, I was blown away further and further to the proverbial cloud nine.\n\nAbout the amount of the food - at some point we tried to sneak out before there would be another round of food servings, but the check didn't come out until the kitchen had their fill of feeding us to their satisfaction. We were already beyond full after the main dish, and then there followed a pre-desert plate, deserts & a complementary welcome-to-nyc soufflé,  and then there were final sweets to close it all off.\n\nService was great, too. Thomas was great with us, and the servers who brought out the dishes & explained the menu were professionally aloof but never to a fault at that.\n\nNew York's an expensive city, and I wouldn't say what we paid was little, but \"the most bang for your buck\" is not an expression that does justice for this restaurant - you get (for no right word comes to my mind) like a hydrogen bomb of tasting pleasure for every cent you'd pay here."

While we had a good meal, it was not at the 2 Michelin star level ... more like 1 ... at best.  We had the Chef's Tasting Menu, which consisted of 7 courses for $265, which is a fairly reasonable price.  Most of our courses were pretty good and creative, though the fluke was overcooked and was too dry,  the ravioli were so-so and the sturgeon tart was too flaky and dry.  The dishes were nicely presented, but not at the 2 Michelin star level.  But the biggest issue was service, which was not even at the 1-star level.  Our server was mostly nowhere to be found and was not at all attentive.  He spoke in a way that was hard to understand.  Our table was not cleaned timely between courses and once they brought another course with the empty dishes from the prior one still sitting on our table.  Not the end of the world, of course, but should never happen at a 2 Michelin star restaurant where I am paying over $1000 for a dinner for 2 people).  The delay between courses was too long at times.  Some courses came pretty quickly and others had a much longer delay.  Water was not always added when we ran out, etc.  Really disappointing service.  Overall, not a bad meal, but not at the 2 Michelin star level."

We opted for the four-course dinner, and it was an absolutely amazing experience.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the staff were exceptionally attentive and friendly. Everyone, from the reception to the waitstaff, congratulated us, and we even received a personally signed card from the chef. As a lovely surprise, we were offered a complimentary glass of sparkling wine at the start since our selected wine wasn’t ready. Throughout the meal, we were delighted with different amuse-bouches after every course, and at the end, we were treated to a special complimentary dessert with a personalized congratulatory message.\n\nThe food itself was incredible—both delicious and beautifully presented. Some of my favorites included the Sturgeon & Sauerkraut Tart (GK’s signature dish), the Two-Week Aged Hay-Smoked Long Island Duck Breast with blistered cranberries, parsnip cream, and sweet potato, and the Cashew and Wild Mushroom Pâté with Ossetra caviar.\n\nOverall, it was an unforgettable dining experience, filled with thoughtful touches and outstanding cuisine. I highly recommend Gabriel Kreuther for a truly special occasion!"

Most dishes would have the last detail elegantly finished at the table.\n\nAfter each course, more food would show up that was complimentary. I was worried the portion sizes would be small, but we left as full as could be.\n\nThe only thing that could match the extraordinary level of the food was the service. We started off with Tanner, who served us our drinks and took our orders. Next Edison was the one who was primarily serving all the food. Tanner would occasionally come back over to help. Beyond Tanner and Edison, there were 1 or 2 who were also around. Early on in the meal, Edison noticed I was left handed, so he moved my silverware (which was switched after each plate) to my left side and switched the right handed silverware to left handed silverware. I had no idea left handed silverware existed! Right before we left, we were gifted a box of chocolates.\n\nThe atmosphere was incredible. It felt luxurious but comfortable. In a place that could have easily been pretentiousness, it was as far removed from judgment as possible. The restaurant was very large and very spacious. The seating was large leather couches. It was a bit loud, but almost in an intentional way. You certainly could have private conversations if you wanted without the worry of being overheard.\n\nGabriel Kreuther lived up to my every expectation and exceeded them all. I would strongly suggest them to anyone who wants a world class experience.\n\n10 out of 10"

            "text": "My guest and I had a great experience at this restaurant. The staff were all especially attentive and friendly, and answered all of our questions. The alcoholic as well as nonalcoholic drinks were really great. The only person that was a little bit snobbish/odd vibes was the woman who kept pushing her wines, everything else was great. The food was good, not great but good enough and satisfying.  All of the extras and incentives were really nice too, little off-menu snacks and lots of sweet treats.  Price is high but that’s to be expected. Would recommend definitely try it out for yourself and see."

The staff was incredibly attentive to our every need, it was easily the best service I’ve experienced in a restaurant. We celebrated my wife’s birthday and the entire team went out of there way to make it a special evening, even going as far to introduce us to the team in the kitchen. The tasting menu was incredible, with different flavors that made every bite an experience in itself. Great place to go for any occasion big or small, highly recommended for anyone who loves food."

We went there while on our trip to NYC and loved everything about this restaurant. Thomas, our server , was amazing. We had the 3 course meal, and it was delicious. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a fine dining experience in NYC."

Yes, go with the premium wine pairing. It applies to all tables and not only the chef table.\n\nWhen I think about Gabriel Kreuther, I think excellence. Excellence in service, food, plating.\n\nI highly recommend it. I am not an expert, but I give an educated opinion. I do chef table from NYC to Tokyo and Hawaii regularly. This restaurant is in my top 3, without a doubt."

The service was exceptional, with amazing attention to detail. Every course was exquisitely prepared and presented. The sauerkraut and sturgeon tart was as advertised, the lamb and duck were unreal. GK has earned their two Michelin stars, and we can’t recommend them enough."

            "text": "I celebrated my anniversary at Gabriel Kreuther (“GB”) this past Saturday, January 4th at 6:30 p.m. under “Michael G”.  I mention these details so the restaurant can validate the legitimacy of this review, as my G-Mail account is under a different name.\n\nAnyway, to put this review in context, I have dined at numerous Michelin-rated restaurants over the years in NYC (i.e., Le Bernardin, Eleven Madison Park, Jean-Georges, Le Coucou, Ai Fiori, and Marea, to name a few) and abroad (La Terrazza and Sensi in Italy).  However, it has been some time for a variety of reasons.  Nonetheless, my expectations have not changed, which is why I felt compelled to write this review given the more than lackluster service we received at GB when spending over $600 for two people for their 4-course prix fixe meal.\n\nThe night began with a text sent by the restaurant that read, \"You're due at Gabriel Kreuther in 30 minutes.\"  I respect the need for a kind reminder, but I felt like my Mother was calling me for dinner.  Feeling an urge to rush to the restaurant, we learned after arriving 10 minutes early that our table was not ready...really?!  Once dinner began, however, service faux pas' continued to mount and included; 1) the waiters constantly serving our food from the right side and crossing over in front of our faces, 2) no proactive refilling of depleted water, 3) no cleaning of the table cloth despite very visible crumbs and food droppings, 4) a waiter taking my napkin when I went to the restroom and it taking almost 10 minutes to hail down another waiter and procure a replacement napkin, and 5) utensils haphazardly placed on the table.  However, the kicker occurred when my napkin dropped on the floor in front of a host who was present at my table.  Not only did the host not offer to pick up the napkin, he allowed me to continue using it.  I’m sure I sound like a pretentious fool, but fine dining is all about the experience and meeting reasonable expectations, as set and exemplified by other restaurants in the same tier.\n\nI know Michelin stars primarily focus on food quality, creativity, and consistency, but when one pays at least double the cost for a dining experience, service must be a focal point, especially at a two star Michelin-rated restaurant.  I know it was at all the other Michelin-rated restaurants I dined at in the past and then some.  Truth be told, I have received better service at restaurants where the bill was one-third the cost.  Lastly, and all good restaurateurs know this, service is all about training, follow-up training, spotters focusing on a small area of tables, and hustle.  Unfortunately, our table conversation deviated to comparisons to other high-end restaurants we patronized versus the incredible experience we were expecting at GB.\n\nTo be fair to the restaurant, the food quality, presentation, consistency, serving pace, and occasional surprise “snack” warranted special distinction.  Moreover, the ambience, decor, background music (Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc.), and affable nature of the staff compared well to other high-end restaurants, but the lackluster service really detracted from the experience, which I'm very sorry to say."

            "text": "One of the best, has to be top 5, restaurants you can go to in New York City. The service is top notch and the food will likely surpass most food that has ever entered your mouth. It was the type of meal where each dish had me guessing if another dish could top it, and the next one always did, and yet I couldn’t pick a favorite dish at the end because they were all so tasty. You will experience many new flavors and flavor combinations in this meal.\n\nThe service was not only the highest quality, but also everyone from our waiter to the many men and women delivering our dishes and drinks all had good energies and character. It is very clear the level of care that goes into creating a good experience for everyone, waiters across the room are very clearly aware of you and the rest of the restaurant while still being attentive to the tables they are serving.\n\nA perfect experience, looking forward to the next time I able to go."

California resident (me) very much was shocked by the generous food portion and flavorful tastes from the lunch chef's tasting menu in this NYC two Michelin star restaurant. Service style fits me. And the dining area is fine too. The food tastes are German related - I recall tasting sauerkraut under the best kaluga caviar starter. Also thankful that the kitchen switched the ube pearl for me in the menu. The ube pearl is so pretty! Didn't want to knock it apart to eat. Definitely will go back for a la carte or the short pre fixe menu."

A highlight was the sturgeon tart and the duck breast. Also definitely go for the wine pairing, it adds another interesting element to the experience.\n\nThis place is a little more under the radar than some of the other Michelin restaurants in NYC but I would argue offers the best value for the price. We both did the four course tasting menu and left feeling incredibly full.\n\nThe ambience in the restaurant and view of Bryant Park are so beautiful. We will hopefully be back again!"

I went there for my birthday, and everything was beyond my highest expectation - hand written birthday card signed by the chef, first class service,  complimentary appetizers, big portion meals even with a 3 course prix fix, amazing dish presentation, and the best kitchen peeps ever (Yes, I visited the kitchen!). The food is prepared and served with love, and I love the collaborative and welcoming vibe in the kitchen, Gabriel must have spent a lot of energy on fostering relationships with everyone, because you can tell staff members respects him from heart. Will definitely come over again, and hopefully can greet the chef in person next time."
