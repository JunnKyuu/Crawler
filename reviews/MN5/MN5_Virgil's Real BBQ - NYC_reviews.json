I prefer to have ribs with no sauce on them because I want to avoid sugar that is usually in sauce for ribs. The ribs were mild in flavor, thereby not being pleasing enough for me, two of the ribs were very fatty. Two side dishes came with the order, so I chose the beans, which I liked and the potato salad which was ordinary."

I eat out often and have never seen anyone take that kind of initiative before.\n\nOur bartender provided excellent service, consistently checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. We also met the manager and had a great conversation with him. Oh, and the food was perfect—with plenty of leftovers to take home!\n\nApologies that I don’t have anyone’s names.

            "text": "I had to take a moment to write about this place while on my trip to NYC last week.  It was a long day of walking in NYC and I was starving but didn't want pizza.  This place did not disappoint!  Our awesome waiter Spencer took care of us.  I was slightly disappointed at first glance of menu beverages I did not see beef ribs. ( I can't have pork). I asked Spencer if pork was the only option and he happened to mention that there was a special that today of a handful of beef ribs that were smoked all night. He went to ask chef if there were any left and omg there was. Without hesitation I said.. I'll take it.  Then I asked well how many ribs come in an order (expecting to hear 2-3) nope he said one. One weighing about a pound and half maybe. Sure I'll take it.  Omg ... this one beef rib was the best. It just fell off the bone, the meat was the most tender meat ever!!! It just fell apart in your mouth. I chose sauce on the side but honestly, sauce was not needed it was so damn good! 10/10 for me. Worth every penny!!!!!!!  Thank you Spencer!!!!!  Please make sure to to tell chef again .. it was the best Beef Rib I've ever had!!!!"

Loved the brussel sprouts, cooked with lots of oil and salt. You can also choose from french fries, sweet potato tots, collard greens and more.\nThey have 3 BBQ sauces on the table, mild, hot and jalapeno mango. I liked them all.\nThe service was good.\n\nThey have TVs all over the place with sports playing.\n\nA good choice if you're in Times Square seeing a show."

Inoltre l’aria condizionata é troppo forte e il cibo si raffredda davvero velocemente. Da valuta un tagliere in pietra caldo o comunque abbassare l’aria perché fa davvero freddo. Salutiii"

The brisket was dry and way too salty, I’ve had much better brisket from home and from food trucks. The Brussels sprouts were mushy and bland. The sweet potato tots were fine. I was let down because the hostess recommended the brisket and Brussels sprouts, saying they were the best two items in the menu.\n\nMy mom got burnt ends which were dry and salty, and my dad got a pulled pork sandwich- which he said is easily the worst pulled pork he’s ever had. It didn’t have a meat texture, it was more like pork paste.\n\nThe service was not very good. The waiter went around the table to take orders but skipped me and left, I had to order after everyone else. Then as we had questions they weren’t super helpful, and after asking multiple times if we could split the bill they ignored our question and just gave us one whole bill."

            "text": "We popped into Virgil’s Real BBQ in NYC and had a fantastic, no-fuss BBQ night. I had the BBQ Burger and my wife had the half chicken — both knocked it out of the park.\n\nThe BBQ Burger was everything you want from a proper BBQ joint: the patty was juicy with a great crust, a pleasant smoky note and just the right amount of seasoning. It wasn’t drowning in sauce — instead the BBQ flavors complemented the beef, so each bite tasted rich and well-balanced. The bun held up, the texture was spot-on, and it was deliciously messy in the best possible way.\n\nHer half chicken was equally impressive. The skin had a beautiful char and crispness, while the meat underneath stayed unbelievably moist and tender — you could tell it was cooked with care. The smokiness came through without overpowering the natural chicken flavor, and the seasoning hit that sweet spot between savory and slightly tangy.\n\nService felt friendly and relaxed; our server checked in at the right moments without hovering, and the food arrived hot and at a comfortable pace. The atmosphere is casual and lively — exactly what you want for a laid-back BBQ meal. Portions were generous, so you definitely get your money’s worth.\n\nAll in all, Virgil’s delivered on both classics we tried. If you’re in the mood for straightforward, well-executed BBQ, this place is a solid pick — we’ll be back."

We stopped by right before a show (after a day of food tour downtown) and ordered nachos with brisket and sweet potato tots... both were delicious! The nachos was huge in size... had good size brisket chunks and generous serving of guacamole too. Server was super friendly also. We'll definitely come back next time were near Time Square."

The service and the food could not have been better!\n\nShadi and Lannie could not have done enough for us, were incredibly attentive and massively helpful with explaining different dishes to us and pointing out their recommendations, not to mention selflessly offering us another drink without hesitation every time they noticed us with near empty glasses.\n\nAt the end when they provided us with the bill, they even gave us our hush puppies starter on the house as a guest goodwill gesture!\n\nThe food was by far the best we have eaten on our trip to New York, the Surf n Turf in particular was one of the best meals I've ever eaten.\n\nShadi and Lannie, keep doing what you're doing, you made our dining experience the best we could have possibly asked for and we will absolutely be returning in the future!\n\nOur choices:\n\nHush Puppies\n\nSurf n Turf (Shrimp Skewer and Skilet Steak with Chimichurri Sauce) with Mac n Cheese and Sweet Potato Tots\n\nBeef Brisket with Mac n Cheese and Mashed Potatoes with Gravy"

But it’s worth it, the BBQ menu is great, every dish I have ever tried has been incredible from sandwiches to wings to brisket, they know what they are doing with slow roasted meats and bbq.\nThe own brand sauces are a great side dip for most of the dishes.\nLoads of cocktails and beers available and happy hour prices in the week.\nThe staff are super friendly and welcoming and they never leave you with an empty glass even when it’s busy!\nTrust me visit them if you are in town you won’t regret it!"

We were also at the table without water, we had to order it separately. The waiter was very friendly, he made the best effort, but unfortunately he was hardly understandable with a mask. Unfortunately I wouldn't go there anymore. We paid $ 285. We wait for food less than 10 min....,,\nEveryone can form an opinion for themselves"

            "text": "Unfortunately, our recent visit to Virgil’s was disappointing from start to finish.\n\nEnvironment & Service:\n\nUpon arrival, the air conditioning was not working. Staff acknowledged this and asked us to wait at the bar for 30 minutes until it was fixed. At the bar, we had to flag down the bartender just to get service. Once seated, it took about 10 minutes before our server came to the table. Although Restaurant Week (July 21–August 17) was being advertised, we were told it was no longer being offered.\n\nMenu Issues:\n\nSeveral items were unavailable due to the restaurant reopening after renovations. This included chili, collard greens, and hush puppies.\n\nFood Quality:\nOverall, the food lacked seasoning and flavor. Many dishes felt incomplete or poorly executed.\n\nWhat We Ordered:\n\nStarters:\n\nBrussels Sprouts – Oily, unseasoned. 3/10\nBurnt Ends – Fatty, lacking seasoning. 5/10\n\nEntrees:\n\nBeef Brisket – Dry, fatty, unseasoned. Burnt ends were better than the brisket itself. 4/10\nFried Chicken (Hot Dave’s Style) – Overly sauced; sauce covered up unseasoned chicken. Portion size was generous. 5/10\n\nSides:\n\nCheese Grits – Watery, unseasoned. 4/10\nBiscuits – Average. 5/10\nMashed Potatoes & Gravy – Real potatoes used (skin present), but unseasoned. 6/10\nDirty Rice – Moist but bland; brisket mixed in was the same unseasoned meat. 5/10\n\nOverall Impression:\n\nThe restaurant felt disorganized operationally, with service delays, unavailable menu items, and bland food across the board. At this time, we don’t plan on returning."

            "text": "After walking all over NYC, I was thrilled to see a barbecue place near my hotel. Big mistake. We sat at the bar at Virgil’s, and I ordered a steak. What I got was… honestly, I don’t even know if I’d call it steak.\n\nThe first one looked like it had been boiled, waved past a grill for 2 seconds, and then left under a heat lamp. Raw on the outside, shoe leather on the inside. Sent it back, got another. Slightly more grill marks, but still tasted like chewy mystery meat that had no business being served to a paying customer. Easily one of the worst steaks I’ve had in my entire life.\n\nThe “sides” didn’t help. The rice was so overcooked you could finger-paint with it. And bonus surprise: little rancid beef chunks hidden in there like landmines. The mac and cheese was the only thing that didn’t taste like a health code violation — but even that was barely passable.\n\nIf the health department walked in, I think they’d just lock the doors and call it a day. Virgil’s should be embarrassed to call this food barbecue.\n\nFurthermore, the one bathroom is in the back by the kitchen. So you have to stand at the bathroom door while you look directly into the kitchen. I witnessed a guy opening a drawer on the left side of the kitchen that looked like it had chicken in it, I’m assuming it’s a warming drawer to keep things hot, but he dropped his rag on the floor that he was using to clean stuff and he picked it back up and started wiping the area where the chicken was. He literally picked the chicken up with his dirty hand, wiped the container with this rag that has just been all over the floor… I mean, it doesn’t get much worse than this.\n\nI dropped over $100 on this disaster, and for what? To watch floor-rag chicken prep and eat the worst steak in Manhattan? Honestly, I should’ve just lit that hundred on fire…. at least then I would’ve gotten a little warmth and a better smell for my money."

Sempre serviti i classici bicchieri d’acqua e ghiaccio (fa un certo che le prime volte per noi italiani). Costi standard per NYC tenete sempre conto delle “famose” mance al personale."

It’s a perfect appetizer to accompany your main course.  The irony is you won’t really need this appetizer because their main course alone will fill you up, but there’s always room for leftovers.\n\nThe pig out is a fantastic deal.  It’s basically equivalent to the cost of 2 entrees.  you are served every meat along with two sides.  This will also be great for leftovers!\n\nAs you indulge, don’t forgot to take advantage of their barbecue sauces.\n\n#virgils #theaterdistrict #nycfoodie #barbecue #pigout #hushpuppies"

The service there was impeccable our server made two suggestions for me which tasted amazing.\nFirst off was the Cat fish. Something I'd never tried before but was happy to try and I'm so glad I did.\nIt was such a nice, well cooked white meat fish. The chips were great and the muffin thing that came with it was both tasty and confusing.\nThe second recommend plate was the Key lime pie, again a first and it was gorgeous, so soft and full of flavour.\n\nI visited again my last day for a pulled pork sandwich and again was not disappointed. The blue moon beer too is also a good option after a day of walking round NYC\n\nI highly recommend this place for some Good american dinning.\nAtmosphere was also great in the evening with the sports on the Big screens. Everyone chatting and enjoying\nWhat more could you ask for.\n\nThere was even a job advert in the window. If I had a working visa I'd have applied"
