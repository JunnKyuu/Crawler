Our group could barely fit and had to squeeze into the corners—even though we’re all medium to petite-sized people. To make matters worse, our food arrived after an hour and a half. It was basic pasta, steak, and chicken—dishes that shouldn’t have taken more than 20 minutes. Overall, the food was mediocre, the service disorganized, and the experience disappointing."

I liked that the room wasn’t overly dark, and the noise level made it easy to talk without shouting.\n\nWe enjoyed cocktails and shared several appetizers—burrata, grilled calamari, octopus, and a tableside Caesar salad. The kitchen also sent complimentary meatballs and an avocado dish, all delicious.\n\nMy sons-in-law split the t-bone for two with sides, while the rest of us had pastas (shrimp scampi, bolognese, pappardelle, and cacio e pepe). Portions were just right, being satisfying without overindulging.\n\nThey surprised my wife with chocolate cake and a birthday song, and we finished with coffee, shared desserts, and complimentary port.\n\nThe bill was $1,080 before tip ($1,300 with tip) for nine people, including cocktails. Excellent evening & we’d gladly return."

Plus he was so nice! he told us what everything was that we didn't know, and he was all around a great waiter/server and the food! Oh let me not even get started on the food! We got the lobster ravioli (it was a special) and this spinach salad with beets, it was SO good!!! We are definitely coming back, I wish there was a 6 star option. (from Owen, 11)."

The bread basket, the Caesar salad, the elegant service, all had us exclaiming in pleasure.  That is, until my entree.  My Cacio e Pepe was overdone, the sauce looking like it was microwaved.  This pasta was far from Al dente.  I mentioned something to our server Anselmo who told me the pasta is all made in house and must get to the table instantly. Anselmo said I should return the next evening with my wife, and he would make sure we were taken care of. The pasta was taken off the check, but I made it up with the tip.\nI returned the next night with my wife and to my surprise, Anselmo wasn’t working.  Our servers were professional, but we didn’t get personal service. There was no bread basket, and the dinner was good, not great. However, the bill, with two appetizers, two entrees, two desserts with two cocktails and two glasses of wine was $224.00. A steal for this quality of food and service. I’ll be back, Anselmo or no Anselmo."

My friend baked me a cake and they allowed us to bring it in, brought it out to sing happy birthday and proceeded to cut it for everyone.\n\nThe food was spectacular and the ambiance was sleek and elegant.

The carbonara, barbietoa salad, seabass and meatball were fresh, authentic, you could taste the ingredients, without the sauce and dressing over powering it.  Every dish we had was delicious, as well as our cocktails.  The complimentary lemoncello was a nice touch, delicious, and strong.  Thank goodness we switched our dinner reservation to this place.  We had one of the best dining experiences ever."

Food was not salty, and desserts were not sweet; everything was at its perfection so I really enjoyed all the flavors and textures of ingredients.\nThanks Steve and Jon for the memorable night and the service beyond expectation. I will definitely go back.\n\nAntipasti are octopus, calamari and beef fillet.\nPasta is vongole, bottarga and cacio e pepe.\nDesserts are tiramisu, chocolate cake, and cheese cake with cappuccino."

Doesn’t look the fanciest from afar but we were pleasantly surprised once inside\n\nTraditional and tasty Italian food.. with outstanding service\n\nAnsilmo took great care of us.. often coming by to check in on our experience.. and make sure we had more than enough bread at all times!\n\nGot the special of the day - Chilean seabass with asparagus.. highly recommend it. Cooked in butter, its so soft that whatever you can feel on your tongue instantly melts in your mouth\n\nThe burrata salad was ok\n\nFriend got the ravioli and found it top notch"

We were  immediately offered water and brought complimentary bread, cheese, and meat. We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers. Both were brought out in a timely manner. Our wine glasses were continuously being filled by the staff. We also ordered salad, soup, and 2 entrees. All of the specials sounded incredibly delicious and made it difficult to choose. We ordered a pasta dish with mushrooms and the Chilean Sea Bass special. Both meals were delicious and the Sea Bass was cooked to perfection. Everything was 5 star for sure and were had many staff people attending to our table and did not have to ask for anything as they always anticipated our needs."

I had the grilled octopus starter and pasta bolognese—both very tasty.  A person at the table next to me had what looked like show-stealing lamb chops.  I’d come here again for sure when in NYC."
