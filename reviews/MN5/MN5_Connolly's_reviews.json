The dim lighting maybe hiding a lot more than it seems, as the whole place needs a bit of a cleaning, and there was a funky smell as you sat at the bar.\n\nThe food was not bad, I enjoyed the Shepherd's Pie the best.\n\nThe Bangers were over cooked, fried to an almost burnt and dried out texture, and the mashed potatoes served with it, were under seasoned, however, I enjoyed the sauce & onions.\n\nThe Fish & Chips were not the best I've had, the batter itself was heavy, and it was a bit burnt as well.\n\nI figure the kitchen was trying to close, and they wanted to kick the orders out quickly, thus some of our dishes were burnt.\n\nDrinks were good here!"

Standard pub with the conventional selections, exactly what you’d expect.\n\nWent on a Saturday after 5pm and was seated promptly for four people. Most of the tables were packed by that point so we lucked out.\n\nFood: Not a huge menu but they have what you’d expect: fish and chips, sheppard’s pie, chicken pot pie, burgers, corn beef, etc. We got nachos to start, and mains: the Reuben sandwich, fish and chips, and turkey burger. All were fine- not the best and not the worst. Prices were a bit high for the quality, but you’d expect as much in Times Square area.\n\nDrinks: The noticeable difference is that they have over 40 beers on tap. We got the Connolly’s Red Ales and they were pretty good.\n\nService: Pretty good for a packed house. Prompt to sit, drinks came within reasonable time, food came fairly short after too.\n\nAtmosphere: Exactly what you’d expect for an Irish pub. They have funky door handles so that was an interesting difference."

The breakfast was absolutely delicious — perfectly cooked eggs, hearty sausages, crispy bacon, tomatoes, and beans, all washed down with a perfectly poured pint of Guinness.\n\nWhat really made the experience unforgettable was Barry, the owner. He welcomed us like old friends, shared stories, and even gave us a little tour of his beautiful hotel next door. The tartan seat covers, Irish décor, and cozy atmosphere brought me right back to my honeymoon in Ireland — a place that still feels like home to me.\n\nI even fell in love with the coffee mugs… and brought a couple home! ☕\n\nIf you want warm hospitality, delicious food, and a genuine Irish experience without leaving New York, Connolly’s Pub is a must."

The serve was kind, professional, efficient and he and the rest of the servers and bussers continually checked on us and other tables. They work as a team.\n\nThe ambiance is lovely. They okay music but we went during a championship game so game was playing which was the reason for us going in the first place. TVs everywhere. The prices are reasonable. There is a great selection of menu items and plenty of Irish dishes.\n\nWe ordered the spicy wings, pot pie and fries. The fries are amazing! Nice and airy and crispy and cooked to perfection. The pot pie was good but I personally like a more chicken knorr or poultry seasoning flavoring which I felt lacked. Overall just okay for my liking. The fried were good. Fresh and piping hot.\n\nGreat place just off time square (one block) wit a great vibe. We settled on their roof top bar that’s closed off with AC but there’s an outdoor are for smokers. I highly recommend this place."

I had reserved a table in advance, though the restaurant was only moderately busy when we arrived.\n\nWe ordered Fish & Chips, three Gaelic Burgers, and a chicken dish for our youngest. The food was okay — I’d rate it as average at best. Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. The staff was inattentive and borderline unfriendly. We had to ask multiple times for drinks we had already ordered.\n\nTo make matters worse, a 20% gratuity was automatically added to the bill, making it impossible to reflect the poor service with the tip. We’ve been traveling in the U.S. for 12 days now, and this was by far the weakest service experience we’ve had.\n\nIf you’re looking for better options near Times Square, I highly recommend Brooklyn Diner or Friedman’s — both miles ahead in terms of quality and hospitality."

If I didn't know to ask for upstairs seating, I would have been relegated to the dark downstairs. Thankfully, someone overheard and interceded because the front of house folks were not communicating well. I initially had a wonderful server upstairs, but a big party was coming in so I was moved and forgotten. I had to track someone down to remind them I had asked for water on this blazing hot day. I appreciated that they found a spot for me near a TV as requested. The Margarita flatbread had some sauce on it, absolutely no crushed tomatoes as described, and just little bits of shredded basil. No one ever came back to check  and I finally found another server so I could pay and get out of there. I had asked the server if something had gone wrong between moving my heat and also commented that the food was not as described and was just told she was sorry for my experience. Never again."

The bartender was helpful but didn't loom. He was also Irish, which was a nice surprise. It's just off Times Square, less than a block, but doesn't have any of that frenzied energy."

Each floor told us to go to another floor which was frustrating. Our waiter ended up being great. The food was mediocre. The chicken pot pie was okay. The cesear salad was alright. The spinach dip was not good at all unfortunately."

Pub su più  piani, enorme sala al piano  e poi al primo piano altra sala, si sale su fino al secondo piano su delle scale in legno classiche da tipico Pub irlandese!! Alla fine ci si ritrova in una sala con vetrate sulla street, con un bel terrazzino. Ampio bancone con davvero un’ottima scelta di birre  a prezzi ragionevoli. Servizio cordialissimo e simpatico. Una bellissima scoperta. Bagno super creativo e molto pulito!! Posto davvero bello!!"

            "text": "Quite impressive place!!! Four floors of dining experience blocks away from Times Square. The first floor appears to be what you think of when you think Irish Pub...host had Irish accent lol, good bar atmosphere. Third floor had 3 bands playing from 8pm to midnight with a $15 cover. The music was not my style but you cannot beat that price for live music in the city. The wings were amazing and the vibe was fun. Fourth floor was by far the best. There was a great sports feel to the floor with soccer on many large tvs and larger family oriented parties dining. There is an outside deck you can walk out on that gives a great view of Times Square and the cool neon light!  I found all the people working here to be friendly and helpful. I would imagine it's a blast in mid March!!!"
