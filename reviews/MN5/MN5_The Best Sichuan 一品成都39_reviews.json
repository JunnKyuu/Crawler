All of the food I’ve tried from the menu is wonderful, particularly their hot & sour soup, chili oil dumplings, Dan Dan noodles, and any of their beef, chicken, or pork dishes. Over the last few years, it’s definitely a go-to whenever I find myself in midtown, and I always recommend it to friends or family visiting the city if they’re near Bryant Park."

Today I tried the stir-fried minced pork with pickled long beans—it was also quite good, with just the right level of spiciness and perfect with rice. However, the pork strips in today’s Yu Xiang Rou Si were a bit too thick, though the flavor was still as good as always. From what I remember, the Mao Xue Wang (spicy blood curd hotpot) was just average, and their signature lemon fish wasn’t that impressive either. Overall, a few of their dishes are excellent, but not all of them hit the mark. I’ll definitely come back again!"

Asian cuisine is especially appreciated in New York, and I’ve visited several spots already and enjoyed them all. I had no doubt this one would be great too.\n\nI ordered the duck at its original price, without the lunch discount. Peking duck is a national dish—you’ve got to try it. The picture definitely looked appetizing.\n\nHowever, when the duck arrived, it turned out to be dry, tough, and wind-dried—not very tasty. I also ordered eggplant, but that wasn’t impressive either. It was mildly spicy, but the sauce was oily and bland.\n\nI paid just $44 without tip for one person.\nBut honestly, the meal felt like it was worth about $20.\n\nMaybe the restaurant should consider hiring a more professional kitchen team."

It’s nothing like the authentic Szechuan flavor we were hoping for but it was good enough and conveniently open till very late.\n\nDon’t get your hopes up - it will do the job but it’s not authentic Szechuanese food. It’s better than your avg American Chinese diner."

We ordered the duck and fish, and both dishes were delicious—full of flavor and cooked to perfection. The duck was tender with a crispy skin, and the fish was fresh and well-seasoned. The generous portions mean you definitely get your money’s worth. If you’re looking for a place with great food and substantial servings, this is a must-try. Highly recommended!"
