For starters we had the nachos and it was freshly made with good topping of cheese, meat and jalapenos.\n\nThe milkshakes are so rich and sweet, I'd treat it as if it was a dessert than a beverage! The burgers were fantastic, great sized meat patties, fresh vegetables especially the well brined pickles.\n\nSolid place for a burger fix with good portion sizes, albeit be ready for NY tourists / city centre prices."

The food was delicious and satisfying, classic comfort with a gourmet twist. That said, the prices felt a little extravagant for what’s essentially burgers and shakes—but hey, it’s New York.\n\nOur server, Salin, was absolutely fantastic—friendly, attentive, and patient, even when the restaurant got busy. The vibe inside was laid-back and fun, but the music was so loud, we could barely hear each other while sitting side by side. It made conversation tough, which took away from the chill dining experience a bit.\n\nGreat spot if you’re craving a juicy burger and a monster milkshake—just bring your appetite and maybe some earplugs."

We ordered two burgers, one with meat and one vegetarian option so we'd prefer to know which one is which. He brought us our food and we didn't hear what he was asking us (probably which burger is for who) so we kindly asked if he could repeat. He just rolled his eyes and he just left the food without telling us which burger is vegetarian and which is not. It gave us really unpleasant impression.\n\nThe food itself was great, both burgers were tasty. Blue moon belgian white (a beer from a tap) was also great and we recommend it.\n\nAtmosphere was almost like in those bars in americans movies where they play sport on TV (and there was TV with sport playing)."

Our server Daniel was phenomenal. He was attentive, quick, and friendly without being fake or overbearing. The burgers were cooked perfectly. The fries were crispy. Everything came out fast despite the lunch rush.\n\nThe place has that rare combination of laid-back vibe with top-tier quality. Tables were clean. Staff worked like a team. Even the music was dialed in just right. In a city where you usually overpay for mediocre, Bill’s delivers the opposite.\n\nThis is the kind of spot you stumble into once and then make a point to come back to every time you are in the area. Highly recommend."

The booth we were in was a little tight. The food was delicious though & our waiter was great. The shakes, pretzels & burgers didn’t disappoint. The fries however, tasted exactly like McDonald’s & were a little soggy / cool. A member of my family cannot go up the stairs so we asked if there was an elevator. They did have one but it wasn’t very convenient & a little confusing to get to. It drops you off in the corner of the restaurant."

Meat needed seasoning, but was a good combo with everything on it. Fish and chips was OK, the fish needed to be cooked a little slower, but overall was a good meal for a decent price. Atmosphere in the place is pretty cool, go check out this place."

Service - it was really just okeish, not in standard of NY service that I've seen in other restaurants. Waitress was maybe tired, hard to tell."

Mención especial las hamburguesas que eran de 10! Un restaurante con muy buen ambiente y servicio rápido! La única pega es que el baño es para una sola persona y suele haber cola por lo que toca esperar. En definitiva, un sitio imprescindible al que dejarse caer si estás en Manhattan!"

We ordered the B’s sliders which came with fries and onion rings, and that was honestly enough for two.\n\nThe sliders were large but a little plain with just pickles and cheese. The patties themselves were delicious though, I feel like I have to come back and try a full burger. The shake was really great and the beer selection has nice offerings from both coasts."

Great, flavorful burgers with lots of additional options to kick the up a notch.   The mozzarella sticks were delicious, and shakes were really special.  If it was in my neighborhood, I would visit regularly."

Glad they had a full service bar and i slipped right in as i went there by myself.\n\nThe milkshakes and burgers were awesome. The sweet potato fries were out of the world. I ordered their custom made Veggie burger patty and it was amazing. I don't eat meat but if you are a meat lover, this is your burger point right in the heart of new york."
