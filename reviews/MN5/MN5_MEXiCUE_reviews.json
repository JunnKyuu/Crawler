            "text": "DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU WANT MEXICAN FOOD. this is NOT real mexican food. as a mexican from california i was APPALLED that this could even be classified as mexican food. the tacos were okay… but they didn’t use 2 tortillas and they had weird meat options. I normally gravitate towards carne asada and chorizo tacos but they did not have that (how!?). The tacos are outrageously priced aswell. I’m talking 8-11 dollars PER TACO. and before you come at me and say “it’s NYC everything is expensive” guess what? I’ve had 7-8 tacos in the BAY AREA CALIFORNIA (very expensive area) for $25!!! They also did NOT give me a lime for my tacos. If you are going to charge me so much the LEAST you could do is give me a lime. That being said, it is a clean place and it’s decorated nicely (hence the 2 stars not 1) and our server was nice i guess. But ultimately I will be PASSING on this place. Do NOT waste your time."

            "text": "The food was not the best and the service was okay.\n\nI got the pork birria taco and chips and salsa. The tacos were 8.75 PER taco so I spent 17.50 on two. So it was quite pricey. The tacos were okay… they were very sweet. The consome was sweet and even the hot sauce they provided was sweet. It was nothing like the birria tacos I was expecting. It comes with pineapples, pork, and onions that weren’t stated in the menu. In the picture, you can see the consome next to the taco and that’s literally all you get of it. The tortilla was also undercooked. It was mushy and thick. The other picture of it is literally how thick it was. The chips and salsa were okay too. The salsa was good. Really liked it. I got medium spicy and thought that was a pretty good level of spicy as someone who enjoys spicy food. The chips however were a little stale, chewy and a little hard to bite into. Oh and my friend got orange juice that was really watered down.\n\nThe staff were welcoming when we got in and the server we had came over to check if our food was okay and gave us water like once. However, when ordering he did seem a little rude. He seemed unmotivated and he ignored my friend who was still ordering and moved onto me. Compared to the other server he really didn’t seem that nice. However, the wait time for food wasn’t that bad. I didn’t time it because I forgot to but I think it was roughly 15 minutes?\n\nThe atmosphere was okay too. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. It wasn’t very busy when we visited. It was just me and my friend and another group. Other than music it was very quiet. Felt a little awkward being there.\n\nOverall, not the best for me but if you like sweet tacos then go for it."

I needed to find a place that everyone would enjoy and be able to find something to eat as we had a few dietary restrictions. I got the barbecue fajitas with mushrooms and it was amazing! The vegetables were so fresh and I loved the cashew vinegrette that was served with it.  Their beans and rice were excellent as well. I got the corn tortillas on the side which seemed to be homemade and were some of the best I've had. The dish was quite large so I took home some leftovers. They have a large drink menu including a few mocktail options as well. I tried the Paloma from the mocktail menu which was refreshing. They have two hot sauces as well including a more mild one and a habanero one.  The mild one had a really nice smokey flavor. The space is small so it is a good idea to make reservations for a group."

The fajitas had vegetables that weren't overcooked and all these other elements that made the dish. The chicken was perfectly cooked, though not very seasoned still enjoyable. The downside is that once you start getting to the bottom of the plate there is a lot, and I mean a lot of oil. The tortillas were homemade and trust me, it makes a difference. The Nachos were stacked. Jalapeños, chopped up peppers, beans, guac, fresh cilantro, and liquid gold 🧀 Yum. Generous portions that allow you to share. Which cuts down the prices. Bill was around $50 w/o tip. Waitress was very courteous and quick."

The atmosphere was incredibly cozy due to the decorations and it didn’t feel as small as it looked, I was quite comfortable at the bar. I’d have to come back soon to try their other dishes and drinks, since they have an extensive menu."

With a good dent in the nachos the cocktails arrived. They were good but the timing was all off. The nachos were also good. We could have just had those for dinner (shared between 2 of us)  had we realized how big a portion we’d get. I ordered a smoky chicken taco which was also good. It didn’t have that fake smoke taste thankfully and was moist and large as well."

The service was slow, inattentive, and disorganized from start to finish.\n\nWe began by ordering guacamole and chips, but the guacamole had a sour, unpleasant taste that made it inedible. After waiting nearly 30 minutes to place the rest of our order because the first server forgot about us, another server finally came by—but she mistakenly delivered a dish we hadn’t ordered. When we told her it wasn’t ours and that we still needed to order, she took her time returning to take it.\n\nWe eventually ordered the Pulled Pork BBQ Fajitas and the Brisket Burrito, both of which were disappointing. The flavors were bland, the food lacked freshness, and I’d rate them a 3/10.\n\nThroughout the meal, the service only got worse. The table was never cleared of empty plates or glasses, and the server didn’t even bother refilling our water. We ordered a second glass of wine when our food arrived, but it never came. After nearly 30 minutes, the server finally apologized, blaming the bartender for being busy—even though the restaurant was nearly empty. The wine eventually arrived about 15 minutes later, but the delay was unacceptable.\n\nAdding to the poor experience, the server brought the check without asking if we needed anything else, left without clearing the table, and didn’t check on us again. The lack of attentiveness and care was shocking and made the experience frustrating.\n\nOverall, Mexicue failed to meet even basic standards of service and food quality. Poor service, bland food, and an overall lack of professionalism made this one of the worst dining experiences I’ve had. I wouldn’t recommend it."

El ambiente se siente muy bien con las otras personas pues es acogedor el lugar. El tema es la comida que la verdad es sin sabor, esperaba mucho más por las otras reseñas que había visto pero no vale la pena ni asomarse, probé 5 tipos de tacos y ninguno estaba bueno pero la verdad tenía mucha hambre jaja pero los dos últimos ahí los dejé a medias. La calificación es más que nada por el lugar y por el personal que es muy amable"

Highly recommend and will return, still tasting and dreaming about these tacos. Convenient to Bryant Park and subways."

            "text": "Vegetarian review: The mushroom taco was ok and it had a cheese that really overpowered it and they didn't really go together well IMO. The broccoli taco was the best of the three options. I wish there was more intensity to flavor however. The corn taco was also decent.\n\nThe vegetarian nachos however were quite terrible and flavorless with too many layers of cheese all over. They clearly missed the sauces on one half of the nacho 'mountain' while they chose to use a weird combination of pickled peppers and jalapenos for heat. The jalapeno guacamole is also okay as long as you don't expect any kick from the jalapenos. Their tortilla chips are very good.\n\nThis restaurant is not a repeat for me."
