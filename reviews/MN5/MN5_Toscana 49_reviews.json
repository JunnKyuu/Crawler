Sat on their nice bar and had an amazing meal; great recommendation from the staff. But I admit I had my eyes on a spaghetti dish someone else had, and it turns out it’s a signature dish of theirs, so I ended up going back there the next day… and it was even better.\n\nSuper nice service, great spot and atmosphere, delicious food… just one of those gems - you can see that the place is full or regulars, which is always a good sign.\n\nWill definitely come back, hopefully with more time to enjoy a relaxed, end of day meal and some wine."

I ordered a Cesar salad and you could tell it was homemade dressing then linguine and clams. Everything was very fresh and homemade.

The waiter recommended a pasta special with calamari, crab meat and clams and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD. superior. The ravioli is also amazing. We closed our night with a tiramisu!!!! The best tiramisu in the world. You can tell it was home made. Loved the experience."

But on the way out the door the waiter blocked us to complain that we didn't pay enough of a tip, despite the fact we paid roughly $29 for a meal that wasn't even edible because it wasn't cooked properly. I understand your country doesn't pay well but that's an issue for your employer not for your customer that already overpaid and tipped."

The service was excellent. And the pasta was outstanding, fresh, flavoursome, perfectly cooked. The tiramisu at the end was the icing on the cake, unbelievable. Only missing thing was more choice of Italian beers, offering only peroni, which is ok but it'd  be great to have more choice."

I had a pasta dish for a starter, followed by pork chops & potatoes & a chocolate mousse for an extra treat. All was delicious. We had 2 bottles of red between the 3 of us, one of our party had 2 courses & the other had 4. Altogether price was costly, but considering we were eating in the middle of New York on a Saturday night it wasn't going to be cheap.

Appetizing and delicious- Tagliolini Cacio e pepe and Spaghetti with Shrimp...melt in your mouth. Conversational noise was noticeable but felt \"Italian\", expressive. Diners truly enjoying themselves. Our second visit confirmed our first delightful experience."
