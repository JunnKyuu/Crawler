This is because my friend placed a reservation on RESY and said that we'd be there for her special day. After eating and waiting for the check, they surprised my friend by giving her a birthday dessert: 3 scoops of black sesame ice cream. We were happy and expected it to be on the house. When we received the bill, they charged us for the dessert that we did NOT ask for. We were dumbfounded that they'd charge us for something without asking if we'd want it while being transparent about fees."

            "text": "I arrived without a reservation for a dinner for two. The place didn’t seem busy, and my guest and I approached knowing they would be closing in about an hour and a half.\n\nEverything seemed fine at first, but from the beginning, the service was completely disappointing. The server only approached the table to mention the specials. When my guest asked a question about the menu, he responded in a rather condescending tone that the item was “only available at lunch,” without offering any alternatives. That immediately made me feel like we were in the wrong place and that the restaurant had nothing else to offer. When we mentioned we wouldn’t be drinking and would just have water, he gave us a look as if we had insulted him. After that, the server never returned to our table.\n\nIn fact, it was the manager who ended up taking my order. He was polite and answered a question that the server had avoided entirely—simply asking for the Wi-Fi password.\n\nThe dishes started to arrive, but the back servers seemed to be pretending to be busy, even though the restaurant clearly wasn’t. As soon as a dish was finished—no matter how small—it was immediately taken away. At one point, a back server actually moved my guest’s plate while he was still eating. We looked at each other in disbelief, wondering, “Is this really happening?”\n\nWhen clearing the last course, in his rush to clean the table, one back server made a mess and actually spilled a dish of soy sauce on my clothes. He handed me paper napkins, which obviously did little to help.\n\nThe entire time, I never saw the server again until I placed my card on the table and asked for the check from a distance. After everything, he casually asked, “How was everything?”—to which I replied, “It was a disaster.” I had come after work to relax and enjoy a nice dinner with someone, but instead, it turned into an unpleasant experience. I left smelling like soy sauce, and after giving him my card, I waited ten minutes to get it back.\n\nThe manager returned it, apologizing and offering a 20% discount as compensation. I left that amount as the tip—not because the service deserved it (it absolutely didn’t), but simply because I wanted to pay and leave. The truth is, this place ruined my evening.\n\nI wouldn’t return, not even if I were invited.\n\nThis is the kind of place for people who don’t care about details, are used to eating in a rush, and don’t mind having their plates moved while they’re still eating. I came in with high expectations and left with the impression of extremely mediocre service."

            "text": "My boyfriend took me to Sakagura for my 30th birthday, and it was one of the most memorable dining experiences I’ve had—not just in New York, but anywhere in the U.S. We’ve spent time in Japan, and this meal genuinely transported us back. It was the first time since moving to NYC that I felt I’d tasted truly authentic Japanese flavors.\n\nWe ordered the root vegetable dish, the pork belly, udon noodles, and shared a bottle of yuzu sake. Every bite was incredibly flavorful and beautifully prepared. The balance of textures, the seasoning, and the attention to detail in presentation were exceptional.\n\nService was equally impressive—Miguel, our captain for the evening, was warm, knowledgeable, and made us feel incredibly welcome. All the servers were attentive and kind, and even called my boyfriend the next day after he accidentally left his headphones behind. Such a thoughtful touch!\n\nThe ambiance deserves its own praise. When we first arrived, we walked through a lobby and then descended a narrow staircase. I have to admit, I was wondering where on earth we were going—but then the space opened up into a stunning, serene room with soft lighting and beautiful Japanese-inspired design. It felt like a hidden gem tucked away from the noise of the city.\n\nThis place is truly special. Whether you’ve been to Japan and are looking to relive those culinary memories, or you’re just seeking an exceptional meal in NYC, Sakagura is not to be missed."

I eventually got both after flagging down another server, but the soy sauce was taken away the second I finished my last piece of fish—no “May I” or “Do you mind?” Just gone. It’s the little things that count, and the service missed the mark there."

In the past few years they’ve replaced their traditional Japanese menu with what feels like more generic crowd pleasers like fried chicken, pork belly, etc. Their snow crab rice used to be a standout dish with large, succulent pieces of crab in a bowl of fluffy white rice, but the’ve replaced it with a small bowl of rice with shredded crab on par with what you might find at any Japanese restaurant in any neighborhood. The dining room, which used to feel like stepping into a magical garden, has been renovated to feel like a more generic Japanese restaurant. The food is still good but maybe not worth the price points anymore. Sake list is still strong, and service impeccable. Definitely miss the pre-2020 Sakagura."

This will be great place for those who like Japanese foods and most likely will serve well for any types of special occassions. Just make sure you make your reservation.\n\nFYI, if you look at the first floor of this building, you might not be able to straightforwardly recognize that the building is where Sakagura is located because the 1st floor looks very empty. You have to get into the building and Sakagura is at downstairs.\n\n10년 뉴욕에서 사는동안 대여섯번 와봤으니 많이 와본건 아니지만 항상 좋았습니다. 음식이나 사케에서 실망한적은 단 한번도 없었고, 뉴욕에서 흔치 않게 일식 분위기의 speakeasy 스타일이라는 점에서 나름 유니크한 면모도 있구요. 일식으로 근사한 식사를 즐기고 싶다면 강추하고 싶은 곳입니다.\n\n1층에서 딱 봤을땐 아마 사카구라가 어딨는지 알아차리기 힘들수도 있는데, 건물의 1층은 그냥 아주 평범한 사무실 건물처럼 되어있고 거기서 지하로 내려오면 사카구라가 있습니다."

I had three tiny slices of scallops on my “seafood” while my wife got probably a nice half pound of fried chicken. The menu is not clearly divided into starters, mains, etc, and it is a wasn’t clear how much food we’d be getting. It would be nice to have a pot of rice to fill in the gaps.

We had a great time here but would have liked a bit more of guidance on what to order, as the dishes are truly complex and we clearly did not know what to order. The desserts are were a highlight! Would not have the onigiri again as they didn’t have a lot of the topping. The wagyu beef was insane!"

            "text": "This is what you come to New York for: perfect Japanese food in the basement of an apartment building in the middle of Manhattan.\n\nNo signs, no way of knowing it’s there if you haven’t been tipped off, the most elaborate sake menu I’ve seen since being in Tokyo and food that taste just like it did in Japan.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is lovely too— as is the transition from the heavily lit lobby of the apartment building down a flight of stairs that is half way between NYC and Tokyo to a full immersion into Tokyo, complete with cherry blossoms.\n\nEverything on the menu looked great and given the location, right next to the UN, the prizes are reasonable. We had the udon noodles, edamame beans, and a rice soup bowl. To top it all off we shared the sesame cheesecake with matcha, which was as good as it sounds.\n\nI can’t wait to go back and try all the other items on the menu and surprise people, as I feel Sakagura invented a travel portal that links Japan to the US—and kept it a secret for a select few."

Service was really good - the servers are really friendly.\nThe pork belly is sooo soft and tender. The karage is probably one of the better value dishes. The food in general is really good, but is pretty pricey for their serving sizes. I also thought the summer soba was very yummy.\n\nThere are lots of drinks here too, so come if you want to explore some sake!"

They also had good descriptions and tasting notes. The food was good. The wagyu hot stone dish was fun and smelled great."

Service is a little sparse but the food comes in waves. Good hybrid and hot dishes; have had better sushi elsewhere though. Good sake though. I did like the seaweed salad which was great with a different twist than the normal version adding a sesame vinagrette and the stamina soba was good mix of ingredients, too. Miso/yuzu cod was excellent, and the desserts didn't appeal much to me.\n\nThey do have lunch specials, too, though get there early - they are busy!"

The restaurant is barely a sushi restaurant given that most of the choices are cooked dishes. However, the chef’s choice sashimi was outstanding as was everything else we tried. The restaurant itself is very dark and had the speakeasy vibe going. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and will definitely return the next time we are in New York to try other menu items that we were too full to order the first time."

The free wifi helps stay connected but I think they want you to focus on the food and people you're with :)\n\nHappy hour menu was good and staff was helpful to give tips on how to navigate the extensive drink menu and food items."
