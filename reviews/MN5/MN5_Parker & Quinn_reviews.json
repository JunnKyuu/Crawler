Last night we seated promptly without a reservation, the hostess warm and graciously sat us, out server Corey was endearing and attentive, loved that!\nThe food is always delicious, flavorful and thoughtfully plated.\nStandout meals are the dry aged Cowboy steak and the Branzino Fish!\nWe also had a side Brussels sprouts which was cooked perfectly.\nMy only critique- the churro cake was more like a gingerbread cake. Was not expecting a ginger flavor profile. It needed more of a short cake with cinnamon flavor notes.\nHonestly above is my least worry as I can’t wait to go back and try other menu items!"

At the end of our dinner, the manager Sonny came over to our table to ask how everything was and if he could get us anything.  We complimented the food and service and thanked him.  10 minutes later he walks over to deliver a beautiful piece of house made cheesecake with a candle for the birthday girl!  What a treat for her!  He said, he comes in every morning and looks at every reservation comments for that night.  10 stars for Sonny!  He made a terrific meal an experience.  Thank you Sonny!"

            "text": "New York City is full of great restaurants and each neighborhood seems to have one or two that will grab your attention.  While visiting the city recently, I was walking near Bryant Park and this bistro caught my eye and I decided to try it.  It turned out to be a great choice.\n\nBeing part of the Refinery Hotel (in the old garment district), you can access it through the hotel main lobby.  Or, you can use another entrance on 39th Street, which is fairly non-descript and almost makes you pause.  However, upon entering you immediately get immersed in the very warm space, and the ambiance is well suited for a casual and cozy meet, or a business sojourn .  The menu is classic American, with a wide and appetizing selection.  Accompanied by some focaccia bread, I started with an outstanding Beet root Carpaccio salad with goat cheese, orange and arugula.  The main course was a Branzino filet that absolutely melted in your mouth; the  accompanying roasted vine tomatoes made the dish just perfect.  The dessert was a delicious Churro cake with Cinnamon and vanilla ice cream and a dash of salted caramel.  It was a very satisfying meal.\n\nTo top it off, my server Cory was just fantastic; very courteous and embodied great customer service in every sense of the word.  I am glad I gave this place a shot, and would not hesitate coming back on a future trip to the area.  The food and the ambiance, especially with the old World charm of the adjacent hotel, makes it a great value; well worth a visit."

Tucked just off 39th Street, this place truly feels like one of the Big Apple’s best-kept secrets. The vibe is cozy and welcoming, with beautiful vintage decor that gives it a classic New York feel.\n\nThe food? Absolutely delicious. I had one of their juicy steaks and it was cooked to perfection — flavorful, tender, and exactly what you’d want from a good steak in the city. The menu has a great variety, and everything we tried was spot-on.\n\nWhat really stood out, though, was the staff. Everyone was super friendly and made us feel right at home. It’s the kind of place you walk into and immediately feel comfortable, whether you’re there for a full dinner or just grabbing a drink.\n\nIf you’re in Midtown and looking for a great meal in a laid-back, charming setting, I highly recommend checking out Parker & Quinn. I’ll definitely be going back."

The food is excellent with some appetizers that could serve as a meal. The ramen shishito peppers are the best we’ve ever had. They make a great burger too. I had a poke bowl special as an app which could have been dinner. It’s flavors were perfectly balanced and could have been dinner\n\nWhile not cheap, it certainly is reasonable and well worth it.\n\nIf I had one small complaint, it’s that they don’t serve their martinis in classic martini glasses. They serve them in the champagne style glass. The decor screams for a classic martini glass. Parker & Quinn is a must. We’ll be back."

My son and daughter-in-law made a reservation for us—two moms being celebrated—and the experience was truly lovely. We arrived around 5:00 p.m., and the restaurant was pleasantly quiet, with plenty of available seating. The ambiance was warm and comfortable, with a variety of seating options: tables for one, two, four, and six, along with cozy chairs, benches, and even a separate area suited for private parties. The soft background music allowed us to relax, catch up, and enjoy each other’s company without raising our voices.\nOur server, Dorian, was excellent—attentive, friendly, and accommodating to all of our needs. The service throughout the evening was professional and personable.\nWe started with calamari to share, which was nicely cooked and well-seasoned. For our entrees:\nI had the lamb burger, cooked medium rare—it had a slight spicy kick, which I personally enjoyed.\nMy son had the regular burger, also medium rare, which came with a fresh side salad, sour pickle and onions.\nMy daughter-in-law ordered the spinach salad with grilled chicken.\nHer mother, who is vegetarian, chose the squash flatbread and requested some extra sauces. Dorian brought both Cholula and Tabasco, which she really appreciated as a fan of spice.\nThe food didn’t just taste good—it looked beautiful, too. Every plate was thoughtfully presented, making the meal feel a bit more special. One small note from our experience: the burgers had a generous amount of onions. While it didn’t take away from the flavor for us, if you’re not a big fan of onions, it might be a good idea to ask for less when ordering.\nFor dessert, we shared a churro cake and an affogato (ice cream with espresso). Both were delicious, and the portion sizes throughout the meal were just right—satisfying without leftovers. We didn’t order alcoholic drinks, just tap water, and I enjoyed the espresso with my dessert.\nOne small note: the restrooms could use a bit of attention in terms of cleanliness and upkeep, especially given the restaurant’s location inside a hotel. Still, this didn’t take away from our overall experience.\nThe staff, including the manager who came by to check in, were very kind and welcoming. The atmosphere, food, and service made it a memorable Mother’s Day dinner. I would absolutely recommend Parker & Quinn to anyone who enjoys classic American food with a touch of modern flair. A great post-show dining spot!"

            "text": "The dinner menu is fairly expensive, leaving the flatbreads and sandwiches as the main moderately priced choices. The grilled cheese was delicious, if not ridiculously caloric, as was the tomato basil soup. There’s better pizza in nyc, but again, price. The vibe feels classic dark, moody nyc. It was surprisingly empty for 7:30 on a Monday night in such a prime location, but that made it quiet and easy to talk. The server boxed up my leftovers, which I always appreciate."

Great location and inside decor was what we were looking for - \"New York casual.\""

Coworkers ordered the fennel sausage flatbread, french dip, rigatoni, rib eye, and a burger. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Service was great and the server came by frequently to refill our waters and check in on us. Our food did take some time to come out but was fine given we were just catching up. Would recommend if you’re nearby."

Chad took excellent care of us including dinner recommendations and wine that would go well with our dinner selections.  He had a very busy section but we were never ignored, and the manager stopped by to check on us as well.  Scallops were cooked perfectly as was the salmon, and even the calamari was uniquely prepared and delicious.  Straight up - It's a very lively vibe so not for a quiet evening, but I would highly recommend for an excellent dinner and I'll bring a large work group here as well, as I know they can handle it and it's very close to the NYC office.  We love NY!"

I had a small group of ladies with a mixed bag of dietary restrictions - vegetarian, pescatarian, and straight up carnivores (lol) - and everyone was able to find something they wanted and enjoyed. We essentially ordered the entire Small Plates menu (7 items in total) and shared a mini feast. Corey was our server, and he was able to make amazing recommendations with minor modifications that a member of my party requested. Our food came out hot and on time (we had a 7:00 PM theater show to make), and everything was delicious!\n\nAfter the show, we came back for light bites and cocktails via the rooftop bar, but it was closed due to a private event. No worries though - Max at the front of house remembered my group from dinner and made sure to take care of us. A round of champagne, prime seating, and frequent check-ins made me feel like an absolute Queen.\n\nI am so incredibly thankful for the care, thoughtfulness, and quality of service that we received for this very special occasion. It was a first time visit or all of us and I/we will most DEFINITELY be back. Thank you so much again, Parker & Quinn!!"

At first, I came for breakfast, and of course, there were no burgers, but it gave me a reason to come back. The next time, I tried their famous burger, and it truly is the best burger I've ever had!

I have more to say about the service, however; while in the restroom I took off my engagement ring to wash my hands, and I forgot to pick it back up. After ten minutes I realized I forgot it, and ran back to the bathroom to find it gone; thank God the staff had found it and reported it to the owner. I was able to get it back, and I am beyond thankful for the INTEGRITY of all the employees. Thank you so much to the team at Parker and Quinn for both the amazing food and FANTASTIC service.

The meat was skillfully cooked. The pasta was much better, but still lacked the kind of depth of flavor that would keep me happy beyond the first few bites.\n\nI recognize this is absolutely a personal preference. But, I would avoid if you enjoy moderate to liberal seasoning.\n\nThe service was excellent, however. My waiter was happy to switch my dinner to the pasta when he could tell I wasn't enjoying the meat. 20/10 stars"

The lady that was our server was lovely. We ordered espresso martinis, mimosas, the hangover hash w/polenta and potatoes was delicious! And the smoked salmon platter. The pork was soft. Juicy and well seasoned. The malted waffles with fruits and whipped cream was superb. I wished I had ordered some to go. Prices was fair for the area and no one rushed us out. Would visit again."
