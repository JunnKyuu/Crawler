The room was noisier than anticipated and I had this sense that I was in a sort of gastronomic factory with an army of waiters flitting about the customers.  I found the service officious and cold.  The overall ambience was dead. Admittedly the prix fixe is cheap at 137 dollars. There are relatively affordable wines by the glass starting at 17 dollars which is good for NYC. However the food left me unimpressed."

            "text": "The Most DISAPPOINTING 3-Star Restaurant in NYC\n\nMy wife and I have always enjoyed Michelin-starred restaurants and rarely been disappointed — but Le Bernardin fell short, big time! I can’t believe this is a three-Michelin-star restaurant flooded with 5-star reviews. Do people not understand that Expensive ≠ Good!?\n\nWe dined here on a Friday evening around 5:30 p.m. It was quite busy, but we were still warmly greeted. The atmosphere, however, was loud and cramped — tables are packed tightly, and servers constantly squeeze by with plates, drinks, utensils, and dirty dishes. It was uncomfortable to sit there with so much chaos around us; I felt like I was at Chelsea Market on a Saturday night. 2 out of 5 for atmosphere.\n\nThe major disappointment was the food. Not a single dish met my expectations for a three-star restaurant. I’ve dined at many 1-, 2-, and 3-star establishments, as well as other top-rated spots, and the food at Le Bernardin tastes like Blue Apron meal kits at best. The dishes lack depth and creativity, with flat, uninspired flavors. You can easily tell the chef assumes that tossing fish, lobster, and caviar into a sauce and slapping on a high price tag will make customers think it’s fine dining. No — what a disappointment!\n\nAt $500 per person (tax and tip included), this is a total money grab. Don’t come here. The one-star reviews are right — those people actually have taste!"

Despite its Michelin-star prestige, the atmosphere feels relaxed and welcoming — even our young child felt completely at ease and enjoyed the experience.\n\nThe service was impeccable from start to finish. The staff went above and beyond, pampering us with thoughtful attention and perfectly timed food and drink service.\n\nWe chose the three-course prix fixe menu, and every dish was beautifully executed. The appetizer trio offered fresh, flavorful bites of seafood. The bread assortment was among the best we’ve ever had — warm, varied, and perfectly baked. For our main courses, the lobster in a rich, aromatic broth and the  steamed Halibut with baby vegetables were both outstanding — truly the best halibut we’ve ever tasted.\n\nDesserts, including a decadent chocolate tart and an assortment of small bites, provided the perfect sweet ending to a memorable meal.\n\nOverall, Le Bernardin delivers an extraordinary dining experience — refined yet approachable, luxurious yet comfortable. We’ll definitely return every time we’re in New York."

One dish arrived cold to the touch, the replacement was overcooked, and although the kitchen sent a complimentary dish to make up for it, we were later charged for it on the bill. The experience took the shine off what was meant to be a special night. I was surprised that a restaurant of this reputation could miss the mark so widely. The overall aesthetic and presentation also felt dated rather than refined."

I recommend calculating how far out you can make it and being ready to try as soon as availability opens up online. It's also worth noting that you can do their full tasting menu during lunch hours (this is what we did) if you're having trouble getting dinnertime reservations.\nThe food, as expected, is all absolutely fantastic. The tasting menu is a tour of seafood and had some truly standout dishes, including the dover solar almondine and the yellowfin tuna carpaccio. I also really enjoyed the dark chocolate tarte dessert. We did the wine pairing with our meal and the wine was a great variety of some unique vintages that paired perfectly with each course. Be warned that the pours are quite generous (this is not a bad thing by any means but come prepared!) and there is one for each of the eight courses so you will definitely be feeling it by the end."

            "text": "We very much looked forward to a celebratory dinner at Le Bernardin as we’d only ever dined at Le Bernardin for lunch. I believe it was the first truly exceptional restaurant my husband and I enjoyed during the early, lean years of our marriage, so it was high on my list for a very special birthday.\n\nWe left overall disappointed in our experience. When you spend a small fortune on a dinner for 2, you expect a degree of care, moments of delight…above and beyond in experience and wonder. Ours was not that.\n\nYes, the food was excellent but the meal lacked those spontaneous extras that usually accompany such an experience. Little touches that aren’t on the menu to make the evening special and memorable. We did not receive a birthday greeting upon arrival, despite my husband including a note with the reservation. We also experienced a significant wait for service; other tables that arrived after us were already enjoying champagne before our waiter even brought our menus.  At the end of the meal, they wished us a happy anniversary instead of a happy birthday, getting the celebration wrong.\n\nThe pours on our wine tasting were, I hate to use the word but there is no other, remarkably stingy (the table next to ours also did the pairing but seemed to be regulars and while ours were perhaps 3 mouthfuls of wine, their glasses were consistently roughly 1/2 inch more in the glass). The extra dessert was a nice touch, but when they wished us a happy anniversary, it cemented my feeling that neither the occasion nor we were special to the staff or the restaurant.\n\nWe thought carefully about our choices for an important dinner for us and Le Bernardin just didn’t meet the moment. A similar meal enjoyed at Palais Royal in Paris on a recent trip was absolutely incredible. We were pampered with so many dizzying extras; service was warm and personal. It felt like a true party in celebration of our mere attendance…on a night of true celebration of a momentous day in my life, I just expected more."

The food at the lounge was still outstanding — the skate dish in particular was absolutely perfect, delicate and full of flavor, showcasing the precision and finesse the restaurant is known for.\n\nWhat truly stood out, though, was the kindness of the team. Even though our son’s birthday is still a month away, they went out of their way to celebrate him and make him feel special. That thoughtful gesture meant the world to us and turned a wonderful meal into a beautiful family memory.\n\nThank you to everyone at Le Bernardin for such a warm and memorable experience — we’ll treasure it and can’t wait to return! We'll make sur to make a reservation ahead next time to try the main restaurant."

However, during my last visit this month, even though one of my accompanying guests immediately let the server know about his severe pistachio and cashew allergy upon sitting down, we were all served mignardise with pistachio.  Had my guest not inquired about the ingredients of the suspicious item, the meal would have ended in the emergency room for my guest.  I was really surprised that the servers had not managed that allergy properly; something clearly broke down in the system.  There was also little concern shown when I pointed out the significant mistake."

For the first time in my life, I felt like I was bothering the staff up upon entering the restaurant although I did nothing wrong and it wasn’t busy at the time. Like he looked down on me or I was guilty of something. It was strange. I didn’t see him being that way with anyone else so I just focused on my dining experience and the food and wasn’t concerned about the staff. I just figured they were judging me or who I was with or what I was wearing although I was dressed classy and covered, but attractive and appear to turn heads which isn’t my fault.\n\nWe spent $900 on the bill for 2 and tipped handsomely so assumptions shouldn’t be made fyi.\n\nI will return again to see if my experience will be better because I did love the food and the atmosphere, despite feeling a little unwelcome by staff."

While the desserts were superb, all of the other courses just fell completely flat or made really odd choices.\n\nThe lobster, for example. It was cooked perfectly, and pre-cut and assembled back together beautifully on the plate, but the broth just absolutely ruined it. The “spiced citrus broth” was so strong and one-note that it completely buried the flavor of the lobster. And if I ate the lobster without the broth, it was under-seasoned and therefore not great on its own even though I could finally taste lobster.\n\nI felt the shrimp cup “shellfish medley” with the dashi custard was just confusing. There was so much going on there competing with each other that it just seemed odd. The shrimp, the uni, the custard, the 1/2 tablespoon of shellfish broth - it all just “ate dirty”.\n\nThe tuna (first course) had no flavor at all. All the flavor was in the biscuit and foie gras.\n\nWhile everything was visually impressive and sufficiently fussy, the lack of (and competing) flavors made this a really disappointing meal, and certainly not what I would expect from a three (or even one) Michelin star place.\n\nUnfortunately I’ll remember nothing from this meal. Nothing stood out at all. Just very bland and flat, and with a service staff that (aside from one or two people) seemed less than thrilled to be there."

The somms are great no matter your budget.\n\nAs a strange habit I have a tendency to focus in on the acoustics of a restaurant. Le Bern has great acoustics. Despite the size of the room, the sound of the place is serene - what would be loud voices or sharp noises in most restaurants get damped down almost as if your table is surrounded by some noise  cancelling device.\n\nProfessional Tip:\nHow to get in without a reservation: Just ask to be seated in the Lounge where they only serve walk-ins. I feel like I’m giving away a secret here.\n\nIt never seems to fill up and everything available in the main room is available here (plus the short “Lounge menu”).\n\nThe restaurant for some reason seems to downplay the Lounge to the point the hours are not posted anywhere I can find on their website. I’ve only been for lunch when they open at 12.  I’m not sure if they are open for dinner . . .\n\nI wear jeans and a nice shirt because there’s no dress code in the Lounge, though the friendly coat check staff (on the immediate left at the entrance) have blue blazers of all sizes for you to check out if you feel the need."

The moment we entered the dining room, it was very busy. The hallmark of a fine dining establishment is that the staff only needs to make its presence known when it’s needed; otherwise, stay away. It’s not Denny’s when you see the dirty plates being whisked up and down the dining room. But that’s only a small part of the issue. One busgirl had an RBF the entire evening. The server who took our order was perfunctory at best. No warmth whatsoever. When our friend went to the restroom, the same server still decided to serve the next course and proceeded to cover the plate with a bowl—THAT DOESNT EVEN COVER THE ENTIRE PLATE (like, what’s the point?!). To me, that’s a cardinal sin. The same server never stopped by to inform us that he had to clock out and another server would take over. The whole evening was a hot mess. We will not return."

            "text": "Went for lunch several weeks ago. Food was very good, not revolutionary or particularly interesting, but still the best cooked piece of salmon in the entire city.\n\nService was a huge letdown. We did not skimp, including having a very nice bottle of wine. Staff only seemed interested in interacting with regulars. Petit fours were slammed down on the table at the end of the meal without explanation. Had to wave down someone to ask for coffee. Does not live up to the service standard at other 3 star restaurants in the city. Nor is this the \"aloof\" French style service other reviewers have lauded.\n\nWould not go back or recommend. Much better places in the city both for value, innovation, and service."

            "text": "The service here is unquestionably top-tier, and the atmosphere is lovely—albeit a bit louder than I expected. “Ok, just ok” is the best way to describe the food. Many of the dishes on the tasting menu felt less imaginative than one might expect from a three-Michelin-starred restaurant.\n\nOf particular note, the Peruvian dark chocolate dessert was almost unbearably sweet and lacked complexity. The carrot cake, on the other hand, was a far more suitable conclusion to a long tasting menu. The bread service was disappointing—it was served at room temperature, and the baguette was so firm that it bordered on stale.\n\nAdditionally, most of the plates used throughout the tasting menu were identical and showed numerous visible scratches, which came across as uninspired. This issue extended to the silverware as well, detracting from the overall fine-dining experience.\n\nOverall, we felt that Le Bernardin did not quite deliver the value expected from a bill exceeding $1,000, though it remained a pleasant and memorable experience nonetheless."

The hostess seemed disinterested in welcoming us—no smile, no warmth—which set a poor tone for the evening.\n\nAfter being seated, we ordered a glass of champagne and expressed our intent to order a bottle of wine to pair with the chef’s tasting menu. We were told the sommelier would be by to assist us. We waited for approximately 20 minutes (by which time our first course arrived), but by then the lack of attention made us feel overlooked and under appreciated so we chose not to order a bottle of wine at all.\n\nThe service otherwise met basic expectations for a three-star restaurant, but failed to impress in a way as do places like French Laundry or Piazza Duomo. The food was very good, but not exceptional. Perhaps like a bad first bite, the taste in our mouth from the initial experience tainted the evening. For a place with such a storied reputation, I expected an exceptional and memorable evening, but instead left feeling disappointed."

            "text": "Dined here last night with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We both truly enjoy spending money on experiences and good food, especially culinary experiences that you can’t get anywhere else. The food was magnificent. Every bite surprised me. All the flavors went very well together and I wouldn’t change anything about any of the dishes. Each bite was different but similar. And the flavors were truly dancing on my tongue. 10/10 culinary experience.\n\nFor a resturaunt of that reputation, you’d expect the service to be first class. But the service did not meet our expectations compared to other resturaunts of the same category. The servers did not have a genuine sense of hospitality. When switching out the silverware after every course, the servers just barged between us in the middle of conversation, and plopped the silverware down on the table. Reaching their arm right in our faces, without an ounce of respect. Even I would say “excuse me” if I was that close to someone’s face and I’m not a trained waitstaff at a Michelin star resturaunt.\nAnother note to mention- we were completly unaware that the bread service was unlimited and of constant supply throughout the dinner. After finishing out bread, the empty plates were crowding our table, along with our used lemon wedges, so we decided to ask one of the multiple waiters who were coming to our table to remove the plates (so that the table seemed a bit more tidy). He seemed shocked but took the plates away. After 20 minutes, we see the bread server walking around with the bread basket, handing out more bread to other tables which THEN made us realize that the bread service was constant and not just given after the appetizer. We politely asked if we could try some more bread, and the waiter looked extremely taken aback, reminded us that we asked for the bread plates to be taken away, made a face, seemed to roll his eyes and had a mouthful of words before giving us the plates back. He kept commenting that “you were the ones who asked for the plates to be removed, that means you don’t want anymore bread!” With extreme attitude! At this moment, I felt disrespected and calmly said “we were not made aware that the bread service was constant” and while I was saying that, he was still making comments, I had to speak over him. I didn’t even hear what he kept saying. But I was so shocked that he made such a scene about giving us the bread plates back. Before even taking away the plates, he could have informed us that if he takes the plates away, it meant that we didn’t want bread. This was our fist time dining there. We weren’t made aware of the rules. And this experience truly upset me a bit.\n\nWhen you spend this much money on a resturaunt, you expect high quality food along with high quality hospitality. The service was average and my experience with that one particular waiter made me give the service 3 stars. The other staff were nice. But not a single waiter has the habit of saying “excuse me” before putting silverware down right in front of your face.\n\nThe ambiance was average. Nothing special. Looked like a regular resturaunt which is why I’m giving 3 stars to that. I guess, going to another 3-Michelin star resturaunt in NYC really set the bar high for me in terms of ambiance and service (which directly contribute to your dining experience)\n\nOverall, the food itself is enough to dine there and spend the money. We did the chefs tasting menu but you can also choose a 4 course option which is cheaper. We decided to go all out during this first visit. I am a huge foodie and I truly took time to savor every bite and dissect the flavors and I will say that every bite of the same dish is so different but similar, and it was incredibly delicious."

Heather님이 추천해주시는 메뉴 다 너무 맛있었고, 세심하게 챙겨주셔서 정말 감사했어요! 덕분에 정말 맛있고 행복한 추억이 되었네요. 다음에 또 뉴욕에 온다면 꼭 다시 올 식당입니다!"

The space was beautiful, with fresh flowers everywhere, and we were seated at the most charming corner table. My husband sat facing a gorgeous painting, and I had a lovely view of the room — it felt so intimate and special, like the city paused just for us.\n\nThe service was beyond gracious. When they found out we were celebrating, they brought out a surprise dessert, and it meant so much to us. Every little detail was thoughtful and warm.\n\nAnd the food… absolutely divine. Every dish was a masterpiece — refined, delicate, full of flavor, and simply unforgettable. It’s no surprise they’ve earned three Michelin stars — every bite reminded us why. We kept smiling through each course, completely blown away.\n\nIt was the perfect place to celebrate love. Romantic, classic, and full of magic. We’ll treasure this evening forever!"

The food was delicious — fresh ingredients, elegant presentation, and everything tasted great.\n\nHowever, there were a few things that left me disappointed, especially considering the high-end reputation of the restaurant. First, I had informed the staff in advance that one of my guests had a black caviar allergy and requested a substitution. Unfortunately, the dish was served to him without the caviar, but instead of offering a replacement, they simply placed the caviar in the middle of the table, which felt careless.\n\nSecond, we had mentioned in our reservation that we were celebrating my birthday. When the server brought out the birthday cake with a candle, she approached my friends instead of me. Even after we pointed out that I was the one celebrating, she just placed the cake on the other side of the table. That felt a bit disappointing, especially at a fine dining restaurant where attention to detail should be top-notch.\n\nOverall, the food was excellent, but the service did not meet expectations. I hope this was just an off night and not a reflection of their usual standard"

I am just out of my depth, and that's being generous.\n\nWe decided to visit our beloved NYC. I woke up an hour before the time the website opened to new reservations for this esteemed landmark. That was the beginning of a flawless and thrilling Michelin 3 ⭐⭐⭐ experience.\n\nUpon arrival I announced \"I'm Kevin, we have a 6pm reservation). I had barely taken a breath when I heard \"right this way\" and we were gently guided to our lovely corner table for two.\n\nThe service was, of course, impeccable. The food devine.\n\nFor appetizers we chose Warm Smoked Sea Trout; Verjus-Fine Herbs Emulsion, Shellfish Medley; Dashi Custard, Spiced Shrimp Consommé, Hamachi Sashimi; Pickled Mushroom and Watermelon Radish, Citrus Dashi and Sea Urchin-Oyster Medley; Nori Cracker; Seaweed Gelée. Every bite was a joyful memory to cherish.\n\nElly enjoyed the Baked  Red Snapper; Toasted Nori Rice, Coconut-Green Curry Sauce, and I felt adventurous and absolutely was rewarded with the gentle sweet tastes of Pan Seared Dover Sole; Romanesco and Cauliflower Florets, Toasted Almonds, Soy-Lime Emulsion.\n\nOur desert choices included the PLUM VACHERIN\n(Jasmine Flower Cream, Mirabelle Sorbet) and PERUVIAN DARK CHOCOLATE\n(Warm Peruvian Chocolate Tart, Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream).\n\nThe surprise of the night was the chef cooking an off menu surprise gluten-free cheesecake delivered with a candle for us to blow out together in celebration of our 30th wedding anniversary.\n\n5 ⭐✨⭐✨✨ for this amazing 3 star gem"
