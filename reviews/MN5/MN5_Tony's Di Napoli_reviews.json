Drinking tap water and some diet cokes we spent 43 USD per person, including tip and tax."

He was extremely attentive, filling our waters and pouring our wine as soon as our glasses were empty. The manager, Kazi was his name I believe, came to our table after our meal and spent time chatting with us and made us feel eager to return for another great meal. The food tasted homemade and was excellent. Next time we’re in NYC we’ll definitely go back to Tony’s!"

The food was fantastic, we especially loved the spaghetti and meatballs and the fettuccine, both perfectly cooked and full of flavor.\n\nThe service was friendly, fast, and made us feel right at home. The whole atmosphere has that warm, lively New York Italian charm that makes dining there such a pleasure.\n\nHighly recommend Tony Di Napoli’s for anyone looking for delicious, classic Italian food and excellent service in the heart of the city! 🍝🇮🇹"

            "text": "We visited this restaurant for the first time with our family. The food was generally good — the fried calamari were delicious, and the seafood in the pasta was fresh and tasty, though the pasta itself was overcooked and the sauce a bit watery and bland.\n\nUnfortunately, the service ruined the overall experience. The evening started with the waiter spilling water on the table and knocking over a glass. Later, he mixed up the drinks, brought the wrong pasta sauce, and when we asked for a different sauce for the calamari, he said they don’t serve anything mayonnaise-based — without offering any alternative. He apologized only once, while already walking away from the table.\n\nWhile we were waiting for the correct pasta, the waiter passed by our table several times but never checked on us, didn’t ask if we needed anything, and didn’t offer to refill our drinks. The most unpleasant moment was when I was served alcoholic beer instead of non-alcoholic. I haven’t been drinking for over a year because I’m breastfeeding, and when I pointed it out, the waiter’s reaction made me feel as if I was imagining things.\n\nTo make matters worse, the bill included two pasta dishes instead of one, and the beer count was incorrect. The food was fine, but the service left a very poor impression. It was what it was — we won’t be coming back."

We started with the mushrooms appetizer and a fresh salad, both full of flavor, and the veal parm was absolutely incredible — tender, rich, and perfectly cooked.

The food was very good, so was service.  There’s a waiter who loved to sing.  He will sing a Happy Birthday song plus another song to a birthday table. During our dinner there, he sang 6 songs. He is actually pretty good. I think he enjoyed more than the birthday person. 🤣  it’s definitely worth dining there."

It’s a great spot for big groups, and even without a reservation we were able to walk right in. It is quite loud, but in a fun way that adds to the atmosphere. We really enjoyed the food, though the portions were so big we couldn’t finish. Overall, a very positive experience!"

You are able to get half servings which is a bonus.  I had the seafood linguine which had mussels,  shrimp and calamari. All the seafood was coke to perfection.  The chicken Alfredo was also delicious according to my sister I law.  Great location in time square New York.  The restaurant is clean but a little out dated."

I have been to Italy several times so I have a point of reference. The food was amazing from the salad to the dessert, everything was magnificent. Our server was perfect. She was friendly, made great recommendations and was very attentive to our needs. The decor was very classy. If you are in the Time Square area, you must try Tony’s Di Napoli, you will not be disappointed."

From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted by an ambiance that radiated warmth and sophistication, setting the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.\n\nThe highlight of our visit, without a doubt, was the impeccable service provided by Timmy. His cheerful demeanor and unwavering attentiveness made us feel like valued guests at every moment. Timmy's genuine enthusiasm and dedication to ensuring our comfort were truly remarkable, creating an environment that was both inviting and energizing.\n\nAs for the culinary delights we savored, the mixed seafood pasta with white sauce was nothing short of a masterpiece. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing the freshest ingredients and culinary expertise. We also indulged in the Italian cheesecake, which was, without question, the finest cheesecake we have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Its creamy texture and perfect balance of sweetness left us in awe, making it a memorable conclusion to our meal.\n\nIn summary, this restaurant stands out not only for its delectable dishes but also for its exceptional service and welcoming atmosphere. Timmy exemplified what it means to provide outstanding hospitality, ensuring that our dining experience was nothing short of extraordinary.

Also can complain if you aren't paying and the wine flows freely.\n\nThe food came out leisurely in pace with the atmosphere, shrimp, baked clams and calamari perfect as expected. Baked potato, chicken, penne and thick cuts of medium rare steak👌. The final variety dessert platter just diabetes inducing."

            "text": "We visited this location on Indigenous People’s/Columbus Day at 7pm and it was crowded! Inside was pretty cramped and loud. We ordered a chopped antipasto salad to start and it was your classic Italian chopped salad with garbanzo beans, olives, salami, etc. Wish it had a little more lettuce. For our mains we ordered the veal parmigiana, rigatoni alla vodka and broccoli rabe. The veal was DELICIOUS…meat was tender, sauce wasn’t too tart and it had cheesy goodness all over. Rigatoni was also good and had mushrooms which broke up the monotony. Broccoli rabe was only ok…some stems were really tough and stringy. We ended with Italian cheesecake and it also was only ok…texture was grainy like small curd cottage cheese and it had a hint of lemon. If you want a lighter cheesecake you might like this. PSA: sodas don’t come with free refills and at the time of posting each soda was $3.50. Finally, it’s worth mentioning that when we sat down, an opera trained server was serenading birthday guests but by the time we were done he stopped which was a bummer because we did have a birthday girl in our party."

The food was decent, nothing mind-blowing, but comforting and filling. Great for sharing, especially with a group.
