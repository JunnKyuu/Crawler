We thoroughly enjoyed the food, and everything was excellent. Maybe just dessrt not to many options.\n\nOur favorite was their kalbi, which was so juicy and melted in your mouth. And Tsukune was great too!\n\nThe service was also excellent. Kudos to the staff who served our table. I will definitely be back!"

All the menu variety is gone, and the portions are half of what they used to be - tartare literally used to be double the size. Drinks have zero (zero) liquor. Used to feel special now feels corporatized for efficiency (smaller menu - smaller portions). Buttered clams also not on the menu anymore. A real disappointment for the residents of Nomad and Murray hill and for former fans."

They have two levels here, so there's plenty of seating, but try to grab a reservation before going if you can! Service here is pretty good.\n\nI got a couple of their cocktails, skewers, sashimi set, karaage, and ramen. Everything was delicious. The sashimi was so fresh and the cuts were very thick. The skewers were packed full of flavor and good portions. The karaage was also good portions and both crispy but juicy.

The rolls and yakitori are great but the salmon tataki takes the spotlight with its unique flavors in shoyu avocado. We enjoyed getting a few small plates from each section rather than two mains, as we got to try multiple dishes over a well paced meal.\n\nThe premium malt beer is creamy and amazing; the ume cocktail is quite sweet so I’d personally stay away from that.

I loved the crispy cracker on the side, which added a nice crunch and balanced the textures beautifully. Each bite felt light yet rich in flavor. Definitely one of the highlights of the meal, and I would come back just to order this again!\n\nCream udon⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nThe mentaiko cream udon was amazing! The sauce was rich, creamy, and perfectly balanced with the salty kick of the mentaiko. The udon noodles were chewy and soaked up the flavor really well, and the mushrooms added a nice earthy touch. It was comforting, flavorful, and definitely a must-try dish.\n\nTantan noodles ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nThe tantanmen was also absolutely delicious! The broth had a perfect balance of creaminess, spice, and nutty sesame flavor. The noodles were cooked just right, with a nice chewy texture that held the sauce well. Topped with flavorful minced pork and fresh greens, every bite was rich and satisfying. Definitely one of the best bowls of tantanmen I’ve had!\n\nOne thing that could have been better was the communication about closing time. We were not informed about the restaurant’s closing time before ordering, and only while our food was being served did the server mention that they were about to close. Because of that, we had to rush through our meal instead of enjoying it at a relaxed pace. Of course, it was also partly our fault for not checking the closing time before visiting, but it would have been much more considerate if the staff had asked us while we were waiting for a table whether we were okay with the late hour."

The Nonono mix tartare is a must, great citrus and salty flavors with such fresh fish. Any of the sushi and skewers are also solid choices. The karaage is also exactly what you expect, crispy, juicy, and tangy with the lemon. We really enjoyed the miso tonton ramen as well and the unagi don. Just a great solid place.

I had the Zuke Maguro with a side of rice, great quality, smooth texture. The service was attentive, waiters constantly filling water (they must’ve seen the other reviews commenting on this in the past). Only problem was that the udon and ramen for my friends came nearly 10 minutes before my sashimi which I had to ask about."

There was no wait, and we were seated at a bar table.\nThis was my third visit to this restaurant, and as always, the staff was friendly and professional.\n\nWe ordered four appetizers and one main dish. The portion size for the main dish was just as generous as it was before COVID—hard to believe for NYC!\n\nAll of the appetizers shown in my attached pictures are recommended, except for the one in the fourth picture (yellowtail). That dish consists of yellowtail cubes, slices of beet, and nuts. It needs more sauce to better blend the flavors of the beet and fish, and the nuts should be replaced, as they don’t complement the dish well."

O visited Japan a few years back and being in this space served this delicious thoughtfully prepared and presented food just gave Mr warm nostalgic memories! Wow. I mean the place was noisy and very bustling ( this was right smack in the middle of the week mind you) and you needed to exercise just a little bit of patience to be approached by one of the lovely and attentive servers but that takes nothing away from the experience. Nonono owes me nothing and I will be back for sure. I found a new spot in the city that takes me back to Japan. The yakitori is roasted right in front of you and you can just get whiff of the aroma and subtle smokiness of the meats are they are being cooked to perfection. This is the high level of service that the Japanese embody and I'm glad to find yet another slice of that in the city without having to sit in a stuffy Michelin rated restaurant to experience it. Thank you nonono!"

Reserve ahead, I came here with 2 friends on a Sunday evening at 6:30pm and they seated us at a super narrow corner table on the 2nd story facing the wall. Level 2 is pretty dimly lit and felt cramped as we were only inches from other patrons. The menu here is primarily Japanese but we also found a few items that were an interesting Italian-Japanese fusion.\n\nWe ordered the following to share:\n\n1)chicken thighs yakitori - juicy and tender\n2) chicken breast yakitori - juicy\n2)angus prime galbi yakitori - chewy\n3)pork with shio yakitori - tender but sweet\n4) Nasu Dengaku (Eggplant) - soft; flavorful\n5) Yaki Corn - overkill with parm\n6) Lobster in miso butter - smooth a fave\n7) Cod Roe cream udon - heavy/miss\n8) Salmon Donburi - small portions but 👌\n9) Ebi Katsu - scrumptious and crispy\n10) Branzino in Lemon Mayo - zesty a fave\n11) Kuro Goma - very smol but perfect texture\n\nThe food here is pretty up to par for our standards.

Reasonably priced and so much of variety, this place has food that just tastes so dang good. Everything comes out looking amazing and tasting even better. The seating is roomy and comfortable without being overly bougie, the staff are quick and attentive but not overbearing.\n\nMy top picks:\nAll the grilled skewers - pork belly is the best imo, but the chicken a close second - came out crispy and golden and still piping hot. Not a bad idea to just get one of each and try them all.\n\nSushi/sashimi - even a standard spicy tuna roll was great; not too much rice, a good amount of fish. The mix tartare was such a good blend of super crispy chips, fresh fish and a light blend of avocado, roe, and ponzu sauce.\n\nAbsolute favorite:\nThe cod cream Udon. If you come for comfort food and get nothing else, get this. If warm, soft, and cuddly weren't weird words used to describe food I'd use them. The sauce is so creamy yet so light, and the Udon noodles are just enough to feel chewy and thick while still feeling like they melt in your mouth. The smattering of seafood mushrooms is the perfect accompaniment, adding a bit of earthiness and texture along w the garnish on top. I have yet to try out everything on the menu here but I still get the cod cream udon every time."

            "text": "カジュアルに日本料理が食べたくなったらココ！\n日本らしい焼き鳥等に加えて、ローカライズされた味付けの料理も美味しい。個人的にはBranzino(焼き魚のソース掛け)がオススメ。\n\nドリンクも日本酒の種類はそこまで無いものの、ハッピーアワーに行けばプレモルやアサヒがそこそこ安く飲める。\n\n席はぱっと見た限りだとテーブル9つ程、カウンター席10席ほど。2階もおそらく客席ありそう。\n\nまた、2025年2月20日時点でホールに日本人スタッフさんがいらっしゃることを確認。日本語で注文もできた。\n\n入店時の挨拶も「いらっしゃいませ」で統一されており一瞬ここは日本かと錯覚した(もちろんほとんどのスタッフさんはアメリカ人)。\n\n料理や接客、お店の雰囲気にこだわりを感じた。\n\n日本食のためいい値段はするが、ここ一帯で考えれば比較的リーズナブルにクオリティの高い日本食を食べられるので、もし日本食が恋しくなったらココをオススメ。\n\nP.S.\n価格感的にはドリンク4杯、焼き鳥4本、一品料理2品で税込おおよそ90ドル程でした！"

            "text": "The food was mid. Pricing is reasonable for the location, but there are so many better options at this price point that it's hard to justify coming here.\n\nWe started with the seafood tartare, followed by skewers of anchovy octopus, beef tongue, lobster miso butter, chicken heart, chicken tail, and chicken oysters. We finished with the Suishingen mochi.\n\nNONONO offers interesting and flavorful sauces—from the tartare to the anchovy sauce used on the octopus—but unfortunately, they weren't enough to make up for the disappointing grilled items. The chicken was bland, and some pieces were overcooked and burnt. The beef tongue was served lukewarm, which didn't help its texture or flavor.\n\nOverall, it's not worth it."

I recommend letting the plums break and soak in the soup so you get a nice kick of sour in combination with the broth umami.\n\nI recommend the sesame dessert!\n\nTheir service is less than pleasant but sufficiently helpful."

The quality of food on each dish was nothing less than outstanding, and you can tell each plate was thoughtfully composed. I described the atmosphere as “approachable chic” — very low key but with personality. Staff was extremely friendly and plates came out swiftly. Already planning my next after work dinner plans here!"

I really couldn't taste much of a difference between duck, octopus, or anchovies, and pork ramen was also bland. I had a standard martini, but it was rather watery. Perhaps other dishes are better. The bar seating facing the kitchen is rather cramped with not much space. I had high hopes but I will not be returning."
