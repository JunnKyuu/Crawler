            "text": "This is one of the best restaurants in all of Manhattan. There are tons of choices, but when you find one that just seems to hit all the marks, why go anywhere else? Not only is the hospitality top-notch from Chef Maria Loi, but the house manager, Alex, is amazing. They are both so friendly and make you feel like family. Chef takes such great care in greeting each guest and making us all feel at home. The same goes for Alex. We had a great conversation with him after our meal. The quality of the food only adds to the atmosphere. It's so close to Times Square and all the touristy locales, but if you really want to experience NYC, I highly recommend Loi Estiatorio. It's literally my go-to for client and personal meals. This past visit I tried the branzino and it was absolutely fantastic, with a nice char-grilled flavor, but light an flaky. The pastas are cooked to perfection, and spreads are absolutely amazing. The food is filling, but you won't feel miserable from trying everything! Fun fact, but ALL of the meals prepared here don't use butter. Instead, everything is prepared with the finest olive oil, and you can really taste a difference - especially with the baklava. This really is one of the best restaurants in all of NYC. Give it a try and you'll see exactly why this intimate Greek restaurant is a treat for the senses. You won't be disappointed. Absolute classic Greek."

            "text": "Loi is unbelievable!!! When it comes to food, friendliness and flexibility. Myself and my wife were having a micro-wedding in Central Park and wanted something amazing that was close by so we could all walk, following our ceremony at the Ladies Pavilion. Alex and Maria (Loi Estiatorio) could not have been more accommodating and flexible to make our wedding day and reception so amazing and so memorable.\n\nFirst of all, the food is a delight. Greek food that blows Gyro's or kabobs away (those are great too, but Loi is a whole different levl of great). The Octopus appetizer (which we loved having eaten at Loi in the past) was a favorite by all. Branzino and Lamb Shanks were popular dinner options, and the menu had something for everybody.\n\nGreat shared appetizers to start, beautiful entrees to choose from, and a all encompassing desert with a little of everything (try the Baklava!!). We also like to drink and the wine was amazing, beer crisp, and the cocktails exceptional (try the espresso martini!).\n\nWe had a few late changes to who was arriving, we also wanted to work with a decor person as well as have a wedding cake dropped off, and Loi couldn't have been happier to work with us and our vendors to pull off the most special day on 10/25/25. I've put a few photos of the ambiance, decor and food in the review.\n\nWe cannot wait to come back for our 1st wedding anniversary and hope you take the time to read this and give Loi a try on your visit to NYC or if you're looking for something delicious in a beautiful setting.\n\nThank you Alex and Maria for making our day a dream come true. We will be back and can't tell enough people about you!\n\n- Colin & Debby"

            "text": "Πέρα από το εξαιρετικό. Αυτή η τοποθεσία είναι ένας παγκόσμιος θεσμός και βρίσκεται πάνω από οποιοδήποτε άλλο ελληνικό εστιατόριο στη Βόρεια Αμερική για πολλούς λόγους. Πιθανώς πάνω από τα περισσότερα πολυτελή εστιατόρια του Μανχάταν γενικά σε αυτό το επίπεδο. Το βάθος της γνώσης, της κρίσης και της ταπεινοφροσύνης της Maria Loi στο πλαίσιο αυτού που έχει καταφέρει και συνεχίζει να πιέζει είναι Καθηγήτρια, σε επίπεδο προέδρου τμήματος σε ένα Πανεπιστήμιο Ivy league... και γνωρίζω προσωπικά μερικά... Οπότε ξέρω;-)\nΣτην πρώτη μου επίσκεψη, ενώ προσπάθησα να αποφύγω να της πάρω χρόνο, η καθηγήτρια Loi με ώθησε να κάνω ερωτήσεις και μου έδωσε πολύτιμες, ρεαλιστικές συμβουλές, ιδιαίτερα στο πλαίσιο του αγώνα να αναδημιουργήσω την ίδια θρεπτική αξία και γεύσεις/υφές στο μαγείρεμα φαγητού που κανονικά θα ήταν εύκολο αν τα υλικά ήταν φρέσκα διαθέσιμα στην Ελλάδα ή την Κύπρο. Λειτούργησε και με το παραπάνω.\nΕίναι συναρπαστικό να εξετάζουμε την πορεία της Μαρίας από Ευρωπαία διπλωμάτη, λομπίστα, σχέσεις με τα μέσα ενημέρωσης και τώρα ως φιλάνθρωπος, τηλεοπτική προσωπικότητα και πολλαπλές προσκλήσεις ως ομιλήτρια σε ακαδημαϊκά συνέδρια για τη μακροζωία και τη μεσογειακή διατροφή.\nΤα πάντα στο μενού είναι πέρα από προσεκτικά μελετημένα, συνεπή και σχολαστικά προετοιμασμένα. Αυτό που παρουσιάζεται έχει πυκνή θρεπτική αξία, είναι επιδέξια μαγειρεμένο και προέρχεται από προμηθευτές στους οποίους εμείς οι απλοί θνητοί έχουμε περιορισμένη πρόσβαση - ο προμηθευτής μεσογειακών θαλασσινών της Μαρίας είναι ένα χαρακτηριστικό παράδειγμα.\nΣε κάποιο βαθμό, το μενού είναι μια κύρια αναπαράσταση για αυτό που συνήθως θα ήταν ευχάριστο για τους κύριους πελάτες με έδρα τις ΗΠΑ. Και γι' αυτό ο Θεός δημιούργησε μέρη όπως ο Τσολιάς στην οδό Νικοκλέους στη Λήδρα - όπου μπορούμε να έχουμε Κεφαλάκι, Κοκορέτσι, Ελασονίτικο, Κοντοσούβλι και Σεφταλιές Δεν «πάω να φάω» ό,τι έφαγε η γιαγιά μου.\nΣε ευχαριστώ, Μαρία Λόη, για όλα όσα έκανες και συνεχίζεις να κάνεις για την κοινωνία στο σύνολό της. Υπερβαίνει κατά πολύ αυτό που θα οραματίζονταν κανονικά οι «εστιάτορες» όσον αφορά την προώθηση εννοιών υγιεινής διαβίωσης. Ένα τέλειο παράδειγμα αυτού είναι το πώς διατηρείτε βίαια την τιμή του ελαιολάδου σας χαμηλά, παρά τις πολλαπλές και επανειλημμένες προσπάθειες της Amazon να διογκώσει την τιμή. Αυτό είναι ακεραιότητα! Κι αλλα."

            "text": "Beyond Exceptional. This location is a global institution, and stands head and shoulders above any other Greek Restaurant in North America for a great variety of reasons. Probably above most upscle Manhattan restaurants in general at this level. Maria Loi's depth of knowledge, judgement and humulity in the context of what she has accomplushed and continues to push for is Professorial, at the level of a departmental chairman in an Ivy league University ... and do personally know a few....So I know;-)\nOn my first visit, whilst I did try to avoid taking up her time, Professor Loi prompted me to ask questions, and gave me valuable, pragmatic advice, particularly in the context of struggling to recreate the same nutritional value and tastes / textures in cooking food that would normally be easy if the ingredients had been freshly available in Greece or Cyprus. It more than worked.\nIt is fascinating to reviewing Maria's trajectory from European diplomat, lobbyist, media relations, and now as a philanthropist, television personality, and multiple invitstions as speaker at academic conferences on longevity and the mediterranean diet.\nEverything on the menu is beyond carefully thought out, coinsistent, and meticulously prepared. What is presented has dense nutritional value, is expertly cooked and sourced from suppliers that us mere mortals have limited access to -  Maria's mediterranean seafood supplier being a prime example.\nTo an extent, the menu is a mainstream representation for what would usually be palatable to mainstream US based clients. And  that is why God created places like Tsolias on Nicocleous street in Ledra - where we can have Kefalaki, Kokoretsi, Elassonitiko, Kontosouvli, and Sheftalies I am not \"just going to eat\" what my Yiayia ate.\nThank you Maria Loi for all that you have done and continue to do for society as a whole. It far exceeds what \"restauranteurs\" would normally envision in terms of promoting healthy living concepts. A perfect example of this is how you forcibly keep the the price of your olive oil down, despite multiple and repeated attempts by Amazon to inflate the price. That's integrity! And More."

I never thought I would be excited about a green bell pepper, but the ones she uses in the village salad are so crisp and sweet! Yummmm.

The food is organic with nothing fried or use of butter. Although the food was delicious, I could not fully give this place 5 stars because it just lacked full flavor. The food tasted very simple and very lightly seasoned, if at all. It was also pretty expensive which I understand because of the location, the services the dining space and so on. However, as someone who comes from ethnic background where things like flavor and spice are such a huge part of my culture, my taste buds left wanting something more so take my review with a much needed grain of salt. On the flip side, if you’re someone looking for food made simply but done extremely well with a more upscale atmosphere and impeccable service, you have to try this place! I’m not very familiar with Greek food so I can not say how authentic this is but based on Maria, (the owner) story, background and how some of the ingredients are directly flown in from Greece, I do believe it is. If you got the money, want to have a cool experience and love Greek food, I would highly recommend!"

Management and staff treated myself and my company with kindness and would definitely recommend this place to more friends and family. If you’re ever in the city come check this place out!"

The branzino and mussels, though, were a bit underwhelming, and the lemon potatoes were crispy but not lemony at all. The chocolate dessert was solid. Good and friendly service!"

We had the eggplant casserolle and the stuffed eggplant, and it was delicious. The restaurant was cosy/nice atmosphere! I highly recommend this place."
