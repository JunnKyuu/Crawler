            "text": "\"A Culinary Delight in the Heart of Times Square: A Rave Review of Yard House\"\nMy wife and I recently had the pleasure of dining at the Yard House in Times Square, and it was an absolutely fantastic experience from start to finish. We were on vacation in New York and decided to pop in for lunch, and it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip.\nFrom the moment we stepped inside, we were impressed by the atmosphere. The restaurant was clean and cozy, offering a welcoming retreat from the bustling energy of the city streets. The service was impeccable; the staff was polite and attentive, and our food arrived at our table surprisingly quickly, which was a huge plus.\nThe food itself was a true culinary treat. My wife, who can be quite discerning, absolutely loved her Maui Pineapple Chicken. It was perfectly grilled and served with tender baby broccoli, fragrant jasmine rice, and a delicious sweet soy ginger sauce. The flavors were vibrant and well-balanced, a real taste of paradise in the city.\nI opted for the \"Everything-Crusted\" Ahi Tuna, and it was one of the best tuna sandwiches I've ever had. The ahi was seared rare to perfection, and the combination of shiitake mushrooms, house steak sauce, arugula, and a luxurious white truffle sauce on a toasted brioche bun was simply divine. Paired with a side of their perfectly crispy house fries, it was a truly satisfying meal.\nWe also enjoyed our drinks. My wife had a lovely and refreshing Buzz-Free Mojito, made with Seedlip Spice 94, citrus agave, soda water, and fresh mint, while I opted for a classic and equally delicious Strawberry Lemonade.\nWhile the mains were priced at around $30 and up, we felt the quality, portion size, and overall experience made it well worth it. The Yard House offers a great value for a meal in such a prime location.\nIn short, our lunch at Yard House was a perfect dining experience. With great food, excellent service, and a pleasant atmosphere, we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious and memorable meal in Times Square. We can't wait to go back on our next trip to New York!"

This place is great for groups late night eating and it has something for everyone. It’s really good for the system of splitting checks as you can pay by splitting the check or pay by item which makes it easy for uneven groups or larger groups, and you don’t have to annoy a server.\n\nFOOD: The food was great, especially for the pricing. The servings were large or good enough. The food was fresh. The food was also seasoned while we all loved how it taste. It also came out in a timely manner. We didn’t have any drink drinks or cocktails so we cannot speak to that experience.\nWe had the nachos, burgers, sweet potatoes french fries, and wings.\n\nThe ambience is chill. They had sports and 90s music playing is very lively. The kitchen is open till either 12:30 AM or 1 AM which is pretty late considering the location. I would definitely recommend this for a late night eat or again large groups. It hits all the spots all the check boxes."

            "text": "Came here on a random Thursday night with a friend. We ordered regular fries (no parm, no truffle), sweet potato fries, and we each got the 10 piece crispy traditional wings (bone in). I got half buffalo, and half Korean chili garlic.\n\nAs a lover of sweet potato fries, these were pretty disappointing. They were pretty bland and not all that sweet or crispy. It also came with pure maple syrup which was not a great pair at all. Definite pass next time.\n\nThe regular fries would be the way to go! Nicely salted, very crispy and overall had the feel of fresh fries we were looking for. Def recommend!\n\nAs for the wings, the buffalo ones were as one would expect- tangy with a slight kick. By far though, the Korean chili garlic wings were great!! A lightly coated, nice meld of flavors, topped with scallions and crispy garlic! The wings in general seem double fried as they were very crispy and had a nice crunch to it. Would come back for these and the regular fries.\n\nThe interior of this establishment was pretty spacious, several floors with plenty of seating. Lots of tvs for any games that would be on. Service was nice and quick however they put in the wrong order and gave us boneless wings first, which we declined because we didn’t order, then they came with guac and chips, which we also declined because we didn’t order. And they seemed pretty confused.\n\nAlso, while waiting to order, we decided to go on the ziosk (on the table) to see the menu there and then went to games for literally less than 30 seconds, and then the staff came, exited out, and then put our order in. When the bill came, we were shocked to find there was a $3.50 charge for playing the games. We didn’t even play- it was opened and then it was exited by the staff member. So parents with kids- unless you don’t mind the surcharge, don’t play the games!\n\nDecent food though and would come back for fries and wings!"

The issue I have, and had with a recent visit, was the bartenders simply don’t fill up the beers. It’s the Yard House, so beer is kindof their thing, but when you pay $10+ for a beer, you should at least expect it to be full. I understand foam, etc, but it’s just being lazy by the bartender to not pour better to actually give the customers what they’re paying for. The attached picture is from a beer that I got, clearly not even close to being full."

The staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive, making sure every aspect of our visit was perfect.\n\nThe menu is a dream for anyone who loves variety—there's something for everyone! From the delicious appetizers to the perfectly cooked entrées, every bite was bursting with flavor. And let’s not forget their extensive beer selection—numerous selections and you can order beer flights.\n\nThe ambiance was vibrant yet cozy, making it the perfect spot for a night out with friends or a casual dinner. I truly couldn’t ask for a better dining experience. Yard House has definitely earned its spot as one of my favorite go-to places in the city. Excellent location in midtown. Close to Penn Station and the theatre district."

You can order via a tablet at the table, though this had to be verified by a server before completing the order.  On my visit, the service was sometimes a little slow, and then intrusive by constantly asking if we wanted more food or drinks when we obviously still had plenty on the table.  This distracted from our experience. Otherwise, a decent place to try.\nUpdate: On another visit, where the place was less busy, service was much better and my orders were handled by multiple different servers in a timely manor"
