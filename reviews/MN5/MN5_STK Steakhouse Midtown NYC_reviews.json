Lobster Mac and cheese tasted like fast food. My Cesar salad was ok until I got my entree shoved at me while I was still eating the salad. Then check came without asking if we wanted coffee/dessert. We were clearly being rushed out. I will not be returning to STK midtown or any other STK restaurant."

The food was very mid for the price point but that’s to be expected with an STK tbh. The atmosphere felt very Miami with the DJ and fake cherry blossom oversized bouquets and purple lighting. Very first time eating at a “nice” restaurant before prom vibes. I won’t be visiting again but it wasn’t horrible for a steakhouse near Times Square. But if you do go- request Mikaela she was wonderful."

I had planned this dinner to celebrate my birthday before undergoing surgery — a moment that meant a lot to me both emotionally and personally.\nI reached out ahead of time via email, letting the team know it was my birthday, that I’m a psychology student taking time off school due to surgery, and that this dinner would be especially meaningful. I requested a customized menu (which STK is known for) and even offered to pay extra. My email was read — but never acknowledged or replied to.\nWhen we arrived, we were given poor seating, and while they did give me a free dessert for my birthday, it felt rushed and obligatory. There was no effort to personalize the experience despite the clear communication beforehand. Honestly, they could’ve kept the dessert — it didn’t feel special at all.\nTo make matters worse, a fight broke out in the restaurant during our dinner and escalated to the point where police had to intervene. It completely killed any sense of celebration or comfort.\nWe spent over $500 for three people, and for that kind of bill, I expected a high-end experience with attentive service and a respectful acknowledgment of the occasion. What I got was chaotic, impersonal, and disappointing.\nI would not recommend this location for any special occasion. STK promises an upscale experience, but they do not deliver — especially when it matters most."

Our waitress Firuza, was nothing short of spectacular!! She was so attentive and quick to notice our every need. But more importantly she was sooo kind and genuinely cared about our entire experience. She is amazing at her job!!! Thank you Firuza! Our food was phenomenal!! My steak was cooked to perfection and the garlic bone marrow butter to top it was 🤤 chefs kiss* My wife had the shrimp scampi which was also a delight and very fresh! But the appetizer wagu potstickers....omg!! I could of ate 30 of them. If they have them, get them! The selection of drinks/cocktails is vast. We obviously had to try a few, and we were not disappointed! I highly recommend the Cucumber Stiletto! Very refreshing, especially after a huge steak! During our visit one of the managers(Seline)came over to just see how we were and if we were enjoying ourselves. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal. But we had already seen her in action the entire time we were there and could see how much she cared about her job, but more importantly about how everyone was enjoying their experience. She was genuine, kind, and extremely professional! Which if you know anything about NYC, this isn't common. We will be back solely because of Firuza and Seline. Not to mention the food is fantastic which is a nice bonus. We'll see you guys in September for our 1 year wedding anniversary!!! Thank you for an amazing night out and the wonderful experience!! Ethan and Evee."

It’s great that they offer a DJ to play music, but I couldn’t even hear my husband talk during our dinner because the music was so loud and he kept blasting sirens every 10 minutes? It ruins the immersion that you are there with your person and are reminded you are there with everyone else. The food was good, however for what we ordered it felt very overpriced. We had 1 steak to share, 10pcs of shrimp, 1 lobster tail, side of Mac & cheese and two drinks which came out to $400 plus. The Atmosphere didn’t give fine dining for the amount to be that high especially for what we ordered. There was a moment where all the waiters gave free shots to everyone in the restaurant but now I believe the shots were part of the price being so high and put it with the price of our food. It seems like we were robbed of our money and time when I can go to another steakhouse, get the same meal but in a much bigger portion for less the price, and actually hear my partner speaking to me. We wanted to try something different coming here and did not like it. I’m sure people would like the spot for a birthday event but definitely not something intimate with your forever partner, even more so with it being very overpriced. Menus felt very misleading. Not to mention our waitress was hovering over my partner watching him put in his tip amount for her to which she said “cash is better”. If we don’t have cash, we’re gonna give you whatever we have in our card. Didn’t like that at all."

She had great dinner and drink reservations. I had the spicy watermelon cocktail. The DJ was fun and the restaurant had a great vibe. We recommend for a nice night out."

            "text": "From the very beginning, the experience was lack luster and border line disrespectful. The younger hostess was rude and short with me and my friend. We had reservations but there was a private party inside the restaurant so there was only outdoor seating. That was ok but how everything else was handled poorly.\n\nThe hostess stated “sit in any two seated table and I’ll bring you menus.” Huh? Isn’t this an upscale restaurant- shouldn’t she have walked us to the table with menus??\nShe didn’t, and never gave us menus for almost 5 mins. We had to flag another slightly older hostess that we needed menus.\nFinally received menus, a few minutes later a server a bit aloof asked if we were being helped, which we hadn’t yet. We were able to order some happy hour items- calamari, lil burger and truffle fries, short rib quesadillas, and a Cesar salad. All of these were mediocre.\n\nMy friend wanted more but the lack of service and poor atmosphere made me want to exit quickly.\nThis place is a joke, nothing upscale, definitely not fine dining. Spend your money elsewhere which we did."

            "text": "We came for happy hour around 3:30PM, the bar area was full. We were offered tables behind the bar area, which were good. However the service was not good at all. There was only one server for about 12 tables or more during busy happy hour. It took forever to get drinks or get the servers attention. Server kept disappearing or attending other tables. We had to ask for napkins and utensils. The happy hour food was very good and tasty. To get a second round of cocktails took extremely long. By the end we just wanted the check, then a mistake was made charging one card twice, instead of splitting it. The restaurant didn’t even bother to call back to apologize for the mistake or clarify the issue after speaking with a manager. Overall service 2/10, cocktails 6/10, food 8/10. Seems overhyped and service is certainly lacking. They also offer shots for 5 Star reviews so be aware."

Our waiter Baker was super attentive and even helped us pick out our orders because we were so overwhelmed by all the wonderful choices they had. He checked in on us frequently and when he told us the “blue butter” was good he was correct - the blue butter here is something out of this world in the best way possible. I got an espresso martini & we ordered the wagu sliders for an appetizer- they came perfectly cooked & were delicious. My friend got the filet  it was perfectly cooked medium rare, I got the lobster mac and cheese it was rich, and lobster was fresh!  We also got truffle fries! I highly recommend those!! Portions may seem small at first but be warned they are very filling you won’t go hungry here! For dessert we got the chocolate cake we loved it the chocolate “crunch” pieces they put on top are so good. Overall I’d say this is a great place to celebrate an intimate special occasion and I would highly recommend coming here. Thank you so much for a wonderful evening!"

From the moment you walk in you realize the size and class of this restaurant.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to find a DJ playing in the day time and the tunes were on point .\n\nWe were quickly seated though I would have preferred not be seated around the edge instead of a table in the middle considering we were celebrating my wife’s birthday but nevertheless next time would request seating further deeper into the restaurant.\n\nIt was almost fully packed with mix of tourists and locals\n\nThe service was wonderful and we ordered some specials but I was saving room for my main meal and glad I did as it was a spectacularly cook porterhouse. Both my wife daughter throughly enjoyed their steaks and drinks .\n\nAll in all it was an excellent meal to remember and look forward to our next visit\n\nKudos to the staff and management"

My first experience in February was about a 6 in a scale of 1 to 10. The food was good I definitely enjoyed my cowgirl riveted and the crispy Brussels sprouts were so tasty. I asked the waiter to pack my food so I would be able to enjoy it again later. When I went to heat my food the next day I saw that the waiter only packed the steak 😡😡😡wth happen to the sides. Why wouldn't you pack all my food to go. I was so pissed I wish I could remember his name i think it was nicko or something. Let's fast forward to march I sat in a totally different area n had a totally different experience 10 out of 10 Jermaine was the absolute best. He was very attentive, gave suggestions great customer service and of course the food was great. I'm glad I went back because JERMAINE Sure changed my mind of wanting to eat there a third time. I would definitely want to sit in his section. It would have been 5 stars but my first experience was not what I expected it to be"

Someone greeted us and said she would be back in a few minutes to take our order, somehow a few minutes became 35 minutes only for her to return and say “no one brought you bread yet?” We got bread at 10:01 which I remember vividly because then I asked since it’s past 10, can we order from the Happy Hour menu, to which we were denied because we were seated in the dining area and not the bar. I just ordered ~$450 worth of steak, I didn’t see the issue in allowing us to order some little bites such as tater tots and tacos from the happy hour menu especially since moving to the bar wouldn’t make sense since we weren’t drinking. We moved passed the point of happy hour and waited another half hour for our steaks and sides to come. The corn pudding was the best thing we got, the Japanese Wagyu (strip) was extremely charred and bitter, which was very disappointing because I was raving to my client about that. The tomahawk was decent but the temperature was medium when we asked for medium well. The sides came but no utensils were given for those, we had to constantly try and get our servers attentions. Lastly, the server gives us QR codes and asks us to write her a review in exchange for a bottle of champagne or a round of shots- which made it extremely clear that she paid no attention to us the entire night because we repeatedly told her we don’t drink so she can take the wine glasses and that we’ll stick to water. The cherry on top was us getting a copy of the receipt texted to us and us telling that we were charged incorrectly, but we cannot pin point what we were charged extra for because the receipt doesn’t itemize the food just shows the total. Extremely disappointing"
