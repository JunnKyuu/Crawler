            "text": "This was my first time dining at Bryant Park Grill, and it was absolutely amazing! From start to finish, the experience exceeded expectations.\n\nOur server Lena was a darling:  attentive, warm, and made sure everything was perfect. We started with the jumbo lump crab cake and salad, which was fresh and flavorful. My partner had the cashew-crusted salmon (he swapped the potatoes for asparagus,  great choice!), and I had the pan-roasted branzino, cooked to perfection. The blackberry nojito seltzer was a hit! We ended the evening with a chocolate brownie and vanilla ice cream that was the perfect sweet touch.\n\nDespite the buzz of the city around us, the atmosphere felt calm and intimate.   A little oasis right in the heart of it all. I guess when you have an amazing date and great food, nothing else really matters 😊\n\nHighly recommend and can’t wait to return!"

Im Innenbereich ist das Lokal vielleicht etwas altmodisch, wenngleich stilvoll, und der Service ist sehr freundlich. Das Essen ist gut und preislich in Ordnung, aber jetzt auch kein kulinarisches Erlebnis."

            "text": "I wouldn’t like to give low rating reviews to restaurants because I feel most of the time the owners and staffs were trying hard to offer the best food/services to their guests. But this encounter gave an eerie feeling that this restaurant and staffs are sending out a message that Asian are not welcome here. My wife and I walked in around 12:45 pm without reservation and judging from the empty tables there are plenty of choices for a window or center tables. But instead, we were seated to a tiny corner table isolated from the rest of customers. Next to us only one table was taken  by also two Asian males. Rest of the customers were mostly white and far away from us. It’s so obvious that reminded me the apartheid policies. The Cobb salad with Salmon we ordered came with a piece of lime on a stick but it’s already squeezed (not on my salad since I didn’t taste the lime flavor and I don’t think they should and usually won’t squeeze it for you). I can’t believe this kind of insulting behavior. I raised my observation to the manager and , of course, he denied anything intentional. But just as we talked, the hostess just sit another Asian lady next to our table far away from others. In contrast to next door’s  NYC grand library’s wonderful display emphasizing minority heritage that one would expect big apple is a melting pot of races and cultures, this type of discrimination is really shocking and unacceptable."

Very pleasant area.Eventhough there was construction going on in Bryant Park we barely noticed.\nThe service was nothing outstanding or notable, but acceptable and the waiters were friendly and competent.\nThe food was well above average. We shared the Ginger Shrimp then had Fettuccine, Lemon Chicken and Ravioli. All excellent and can be recommended.\nThe wine was average / slightly above; however, I have to say that I find it difficult to find an average daily restaurant with a good wine menu.\nOverall, I warmly recommend Bryant Park Grill."

Setting is very nice on a sunny Autumn day and couldn’t be better until foods were served. I ordered $47 steak frites with “Medium”. Steak was very well done but I didn’t want to send the food back as I didn’t want to ruin the atmosphere. But I thought I would give some feedback and the waiter said “It looks medium to me. What do you want me to do?” the comment was unbelievable . He made our team lunch horrible and we left without birthday cake as a dessert this place is not for tourists only. There are many offices and we want to celebrate our special day at this beautiful restaurant. They really need to do a better job"

At 4:20, we ended up not having time because we were going to drunk Dracula at 5pm. So we ordered, then decided not to wait and left.\n\nI've been a bartender and server at restaurants since I was 16. Girl, how are you gonna make money with that kinda attitude? It should be so easy for you! It's the middle of NYC and everything is expensive. I get it's a weird time and likely shift change or end of shift, but that isn't MY fault."

I simply wanted to enjoy a glass of champagne and sit at an outdoor table. Usually, when I visit restaurants, I also order food, but this time I was refused seating twice.\n\nWhen I came back the second time, the hostess not only refused again but even suggested that I visit two neighboring restaurants instead. I believe management should know that a guest who intentionally comes to their restaurant is being directed elsewhere.\n\nI sat across from the entrance for about an hour and a half, right in front of the hostess, mentioning that I’d love to have champagne once a table was available. The restaurant was almost empty, with only a few tables occupied, yet no one offered me a seat.\n\nI often visit beautiful places and love writing positive reviews about great service and atmosphere. Unfortunately, this restaurant showed clear discrimination and a lack of respect toward guests.\nRestaurants should value their customers and not judge them by appearance, and should never refuse a table just because someone wants to start with a glass of champagne.\nVery disappointed — especially because I genuinely wanted to enjoy their cuisine and atmosphere."

As a food content creator, I originally came here to take beautiful photos and promote this place positively, but what happened completely changed my mind.\n\nOne Chinese bald server had an extremely rude attitude. We repeatedly asked for the check, but he never came. Instead, he kept serving other large tables and chatting with other guests, deliberately ignoring us. Finally, he shouted at us, saying that we “must wait 20 minutes to pay because that’s the rule here,” and then added in Chinese, “This is not the kind of place you think it is.” The aggressive tone and words were filled with discrimination and arrogance. We could understand if the rule was that only he could handle the bill, but the way he yelled at us was simply unacceptable.\n\nEven after we signed the tip as usual, he still forced us to open the bill in front of him to check whether we had signed the tip, which was humiliating and discriminatory. Other staff members were polite, but this one server’s behavior completely ruined the experience.\n\nThis is my very first time ever leaving a negative review on Google. Instead of recommending this restaurant, I now feel obligated to warn everyone: avoid this place at all costs. I will never come back."

Probably busy but still, he could probably earn better tips if he slowed down. Additionally I asked if the fries were gluten free. I *think* he said there is cross contamination because they fry it in the same fryer as the calamari.

The duck was perfectly cooked and was tender on the inside. It came with fresh beans, a buttery sauce, cilantro and grapes on top mixed with the sauce. Some parts of the duck were quite fatty, so I thought it would definitely be better if it came with rice or potatoes instead of a lot of buttery sauce. However, the fresh beans were great. Their New York Cheesecake was also very delicious, and the waiter was amazing."

Too bad the second roof area closed.\n\nThe bar tender serve my bloody orange with strong kick  with too much rum or vodka, which is not impressing unlike the drink i got my Blossom restaurant.

I would say you nailed it, who ever the Chef making it I would rate 10/10.  Lamb is my favorites…whenever I dined in the finest restaurant, if lamb is in the menu, I always want to try…\n\nAdditionally, the customer care is exceptional!!! very flexible to their customer."

We ordered a variety of plates after that. The Vietnamese spring roll were big and complimented well with the peanut sauce. Also tried the chicken kabob which was delicious.

We ate outside, the atmosphere was  lovely, the waiters were friendly and all seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. 3 full meals and 3 appetizers came out in 6 minutes. Now this was very nice and fast, but I'm not sure if its because they had just opened, or because they had the food pre-made. Either way it was all pretty good. I got the breakfast burrito off of the brunch menu. It was BIG, for NYC prices this was a nice full plate of food, a whole burrito and a salad. The burrito was really good, it had scrambled eggs and beans in it, but I found the salad to be lacking. It was just lettuce, straight out off the box topped with Pico de gallo and also some kind of vinegrette dressing. The combination of all 3 was alright but not great. Everyone else got the soup of the day  and all really liked it. This was a nice meal, pricey, of course, but pretty good food and amount of food for the total cost. To put in perspective, 3 soups and 3 entrees was $114."

            "text": "The Burrata salad starter paired well with the shrimp. Be sure to ask for more bread as that shrimp oil is verysavory that you will want to dip more.\n\nSteak was cooked to medium rare perfection as instructed. As for the desserts, go for the classics and not the olive oil cake. As of Jun 2025, you will fork out 50-70 for a three course meal here. Decently priced considering the central location and food quality."

We were seated outside in the clear tent so we could take in the view of the park. The twinkle lights added a special effect to the experience. Dinner was excellent, the salmon was cooked to my liking and served with plenty of vegetables. A nice serving size.\nSoup and salad were flavorful and fresh. I especially loved the bread and butter.\nServer was friends, answered our questions, and very attentive.  I love this place! A must visit."

Challah French Toast with homemade strawberry jam and mascarpone mousse was delicious. My husband also enjoyed his banana Walnut buttermilk pancakes. The pear salad was tasty. The staff are very professional and attentive."

Buzzy businessy bar scene, elegant large dining room with picture windows overlooking Bryant Park and a well heated tent overlooking the spring park plantings. We went in jeans and hoodies so they sat us in the tent with several other tourists, but the meal was equally good. Had grilled duck in a balsamic glaze with cherries and a creamy polenta. Skipped the crab cakes and the Moroccan lamb skewers with dips, and went straight to a quinoa platter with roast vegetables. As good as the duck! Had delicious Blackberry Mojitos too."

            "text": "I strongly believe that Bryant Park Grill is worth visiting primarily for its stunning outdoor seating area. The food, in my opinion, is rather average and nothing to write home about. On the other hand, I must commend the staff for being extremely welcoming and efficient. If you plan to enjoy the outdoor seating during warmer weather, my recommendation is to arrive early for lunch. Personally, I find the food to be quite bland and definitely overpriced. However, if your goal is to savor an appetizer and a drink while taking in the views, then this is the ideal spot for you. If you're solely interested in finding food around Bryant Park, you might want to consider visiting L’Adresse American Bistro or Los Tacos 1 instead."

She gave us the best seats in the house despite being brushed off by the inside hostesses for not having a reservation and made us feel welcome. It's the holiday season greetings really do set the tone😁\n\nBeyond that our appetizers and lunch entrees were delicious. Can't wait to try the shrimp Cobb next time and those orange drinks w the flowered I saw the ladies having."
