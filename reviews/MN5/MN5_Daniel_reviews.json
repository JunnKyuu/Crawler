In my research, Daniel came highly recommended\n\nI have had some really amazing fine dinning experiences in my local area of Australia and New Zealand but Daniel is at another stratospheric level of fine dinning. I am so glad that I actually had the opportunity to visit\n\nMy first night's experience of the delightful Mushroom Consommé followed by the Wagyu Beef and finished off with the Fig + Cheese Cake dessert was so incredible, I had to come back a second night to try their other delectable offerings\n\nWhen I asked at the end of the first night if they were able to seat me the following night, the team was amazing and found me a spot\n\nThe second night was just as phenomenal with the Scallop Carpaccio, Blue Fin Tuna and Moroccan Chocolate\n\nThe service both nights was warm, welcoming and so personable which I so appreciate. The atmosphere was beautifully elegant. The food was at its own divine level of taste, textures and creativity\n\nA big thank you to Daniel, Brian, Peter, Alan, Jorje, Matthew and the greater Daniel team for making me feel so welcome and the whole experience at Daniel - both nights so amazing. I do look forward to being back at Daniel soon"

I was close by and thought I would pop in hoping to get seated last minute. Understandably I was turned away, I was wearing a Huey Lewis and the news tee-shirt that was covered in cigarette burns and ripped cargo pants as well as it being fully booked and not having a reservation. Cut to 3 weeks later my firm just got the A.P. Moller Maersk contract and I took my new Danish business associates here to celebrate. It was a lovely evening my company was impressed with the atmosphere and after a decadent evening I can confidently say this will be my new go to for entertaining"

            "text": "I finally had the chance to dine at Daniel for my birthday and we opted for the 5-course prix fixe menu.\n\nCanapes: Excellent start. There was a uni bite I really enjoyed, though I wish I remembered the rest—it all went by quickly but set the tone nicely.\n\nMaine Sea Scallop Carpaccio: A solid beginning to the courses. The scallop paired beautifully with grapefruit—fresh, light, and delicious.\n\nWarm Seafood Fricassee: This one was interesting. It came with small pieces of snail, octopus, squid, mussels, a SINGLE small pieces of lobster, and scallop. The seafood itself was great, though the sauce threw me off—it had a peanut or nutty flavor that didn’t work for me (personal preference, since I’m not a fan of nutty sauces). The squid was also a little chewy. Funny enough, while I was jotting notes on my phone, the waiter came over almost immediately to check in and even offered to replace the dish. I appreciated the attentiveness but decided to keep it.\n\nBlack Cod: Served with caviar and beluga lentils. The texture of the fish was tender and cooked well, though slightly bland.\n\nPennsylvania Duck: Perfectly cooked—medium and tender—but I wasn’t a fan of the olives embedded in the duck or the pecan sauce, which I felt didn’t complement the dish.\n\nMekonga (Dessert): A dark chocolate dessert with coconut milk jam. I didn’t get much of the coconut flavor, but overall it was a solid, well balanced dessert.\n\nThey also served freshly baked madeleines at the end, which were decent but not particularly memorable. The chocolate piece with gold flakes looked pretty but didn’t taste special, and the mini coffee macaron was a definite miss for me.\n\nAt the end of the night, they invited us into the kitchen for a quick look. It was a kind gesture, though there wasn’t much to see—nice touch, but not particularly rewarding… meh…\n\nOverall, I’d give Daniel a strong 4 stars. The service was exceptional—though it did slow down once the restaurant got busy, and we ended up waiting almost 30 minutes for dessert. Still, it was a great experience overall. A few dishes could use small tweaks. But, solid"

I opted for the three-course prix fixe: the scallop carpaccio was bland, and the duck was overly salty, tough, and greasy. The desserts, however, were excellent. Based on my experience, I suspect its Michelin star rests largely on presentation and pastry, rather than the overall quality of the meal."

Every plate demonstrated mastery of multitudes of culinary technique and deep caring and thought. The entire staff treated us as welcome guests. The atmosphere was beautiful, highly professional, but also comfortable and relaxed. And if I may say so, although the evening is expensive objectively, it is not expensive for the food and experience received. Compare Daniel with the many mediocre $100+ “omakese” sushi restaurants, and Daniel is a bargain."

I have several dietary restrictions, and Matthew, the maitre d’hôtel, went above and beyond to make sure I felt completely safe and cared for.

That kind of detail and thoughtfulness is rare, and it set the tone for a worry-free evening.\n\nThe food itself was unbelievable — beautifully prepared, balanced, and truly memorable.

Watching the brigade at work, every plate crafted like a symphony of art, was mesmerizing. You see the precision, the passion, the dedication to excellence in every movement.\n\nAnd then — meeting Chef Daniel himself. What a moment. He is not only a master of cuisine but also a gentleman of rare warmth and generosity. He made us feel unique, welcomed, and valued, taking time to speak with us with genuine sincerity. It wasn’t just a meal, it was an experience that touched the heart as much as the palate. Truly one of the most memorable evenings of my life."

            "text": "Daniel is unequivocally one of my favorite fine dining restaurants in New York City, and every visit to Daniel is an indulgent journey into high-level gastronomy.\n\nI always choose the eight course tasting menu, and my two standout favorites over the years are their New York foie gras and Maine sea scallops, each bite exquisitely crafted. Every course arrives as a work of art, beautifully plated, deeply flavorful, and thoughtfully paced. It is the literal definition of culinary artistry and fine dining.\n\nThe experience is elegant from start to finish. The service is polished yet warm, and the dining room is refined with coffered ceilings, sparkling chandeliers, and understated sophistication. Though the pricing is high, with the eight course menu running around $295 to $300 per person, for NYC standards this is absolutely worth it, especially if you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to splurge on truly memorable food.\n\nWhat saddens me is that Michelin currently rates Daniel at only one star, a puzzling demotion for a restaurant that consistently delivers excellence in execution and creativity. Daniel previously held two Michelin stars, and before that even three, which makes this latest rating feel like an injustice.\n\nDespite Michelin’s concerns about inconsistency, to me Daniel remains a gem, a place where passion for seasonal French cuisine meets meticulous presentation, and where each course showcases top tier ingredients like foie gras and scallops at their peak. Every visit reaffirms why it remains one of the finest and most reliable dining experiences in New York.\n\nIn short, it is expensive, but absolutely worth it. If you are looking to celebrate or treat yourself, Daniel never disappoints."

My server gave perfect service and I wish him the best. The presentation of the dishes were extremely creative like a work of art. Many 3 star restaurants don't have such creativity and presentation to their dishes. I really enjoyed the rabbit dish and the lamb saddle. The sauces paired with both of these dishes were amazing. I also enjoyed their array of breads to choose from as well as the cheese tray add on. That was excellent. Overall, I recommend coming to Daniel for an excellent meal, service, and a memorable experience. I've been to around 50 Michelin star restaurants so I can compare this restaurant to others. I think this restaurant is definitely worth a visit as it sets its self apart from other Michelin star restaurants."

Days before my visit, I received a thoughtful email from Penn, who personally welcomed me with great warmth on the day of the reservation — a gesture of hospitality that already reflects the restaurant’s standard of excellence.\n\nWhile waiting for my companion, I went to the bar and accepted a recommendation from one of the staff to try a signature cocktail. A perfect choice: balanced, sophisticated, and full of personality — the drink set the tone for the culinary journey that would follow.\n\nIn the main dining room, we were welcomed by Allan, whose impeccable service elevated the entire evening. With technical mastery and evident passion, he introduced each dish with rich detail, providing context about the ingredients, techniques, and origins. Each course was a true sensory exploration — complex flavors, refined presentation, and surprising textures.\n\nAt the end of the dinner, we had the opportunity to visit the kitchen. The space conveyed discipline and organization, reflecting the same care present in every dish served.\n\nWithout a doubt, Daniel delivers a high-level gastronomic experience, defined by attention to detail and the dedication of the entire team. A truly special evening in one of New York’s Michelin-starred classics.\n\nWe chose the 5-course tasting menu."

            "text": "Our evening at Daniel NYC began on a high note with a warm welcome and a stunning ambiance—certainly among the city’s best settings for fine dining. We opted for the seven-course tasting menu with wine pairings, hoping for an unforgettable culinary journey. However, as the evening progressed, the dishes fell surprisingly short on flavor, leaving much to be desired in taste and creativity. Additionally, the service, while polished, lacked genuine engagement. Some servers seemed to be going through the motions, delivering rehearsed lines rather than showing true attentiveness to the guests. While the setting is exceptional, the overall experience felt more style than substance."

Thank you Alexandra for being so kind and thoughtful. Mr Brian ( the manager) made time to emailed and called me and reached out to explain how I can be reassured by his team members. Started with the first welcoming smile from Ashley. I have met the politeness of your staff like Chris, Allen and Laura, to the entire team.\nChris was very helpful and humorous as well!! There was no dull moment. We had the opportunity to see the beautiful kitchen at the back where a lot of guests were enjoying to see.\nThe five pre fixe menu was very well presented and simultaneously served. I was impressed by how well systematic and synchronized they did … it’s really impressive!!!! We had a big long table of 13 guests. Especially located in the corner where we can’t get other guests distracted and disturbed… well thought out and planned for.\nRestaurant Daniel stood up to me wildest expectations and even more.\nThe only thing I could say is that, the restrooms located. It was quite steep and probably challenging to those guests who have physical disabilities and older in general. I would like a need to be concerned about safety although it has a sturdy railing.\nI will share the photos and videos for you to see.\nDefinitely I will highly recommend this opulent place.\nThe entire team deserves high praises for their dedication and professionalism to commit such great work and service!!!\nKudos to Chef Daniel Boulud !!!!\n# French # Chef # Michelin # Star ⭐️ 👍🏼♥️\n\nThank you all !!!\n\nLove ❤️\nVenus 🌸"

            "text": "I consider one of the best restaurants in the whole world. Firstly the interior designer is impressive with such a nice taste for art and the wood panels in organic lines. It’s sublime, you feel that you are in an Italian Palazzo, but a modern one. The staff is beyond friendly, they are well prepared. Sydney was very certain and confident about the wines and made the right choices for both of us. I love to find people passionate about what they do in life, this makes a huge difference. We chose the option in the menu with 5 courses, all them extremely well presented and deliciously each one. We only missed a piano as background, but the atmosphere was so welcoming and the other guests so respectfully quiet that we felt honoured to be in the middle. Highly recommend this restaurant for everyone that wants a nice dinner and gastronomic experience in French cuisine in Manhattan. My partner is French, and he approved everything and agreed with my feedback. We will definitely will return next time in NY."

            "text": "Celebrated a special day at Daniel and was very happy with the decision. Professional and attentive staff that are very accommodating and knowledgeable.\n\nWe went with the five course tasting menu, which started with a delightful set of amuse bouche. Bread service had this unforgettable brioche that had a flaky crust similar to a croissant.  All breads were served warm with very good quality butter.\n\nIt's hard to get into detail with the food because of the delicate and complex composition that each dish presents. Everything served was delicious and innovative. I'm not sure how often the menu changes, but i encourage you to take a look. Good food at a restaurant of this caliber is expected,  but when I leave the establishment having learned new food terms,  eye-opening techniques, and feel the sense of care put into everything they do, elevates the experience that much more,\n\nI have posted a few photos of the dishes, but please forgive phone cam color balance. They don't do the actual justice.  The restaurant is well lit in a way that is not harsh but also not dim like some are. All the lighting, art, and textures are placed in a way that isn't in your face but compliments the restaurant as a whole.\n\nIt certainly is a bucket list restaurant for us, and we surely will be back sooner than later."

Overall it’s a great formal dinner for new year eve."

            "text": "This had to have been one of the best dining experiences in my life. I have eaten at so many Michelin restaurants around the world and the service at this place was absolutely outstanding. A 200/10 rating in terms of service. our waiter (Matthew who is now a Maitre D there!) had been working there for many years, gave fantastic suggestions on what to order, helped us figure out if we want a whole bottle of wine what type of wine, and how much of it we should order in conjunction with our meal. What really pushed the service over the top was that everything was perfectly organized, and our waiter went to the back room to even ask if they had extra leftover pastries for us as they had some freshly baked ones earlier that day. We left this restaurant so ridiculously fooled because of all the free dessert. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. The interior was beautiful. We got a great side table where we could people watch and enjoy, the wine was superb. 100% would go back again and definitely recommend. I even felt that the price was actually quite fair considering the ingredient quality and amount of food you get 10 out of 10 place. Update 2024: we returned and were served by Matthew and Jorge, service, food and ambiance still exceptional. Will definitely return as usual!"

            "text": "Still one of the greatest New York restaurants.  The langoustine crudo is the best in the world.  The John Dory also was excellent.  Scallops can be difficult to make good and here Daniel failed, it seemed undercooked and tasteless. But the worst was the lamb which was extraordinarily tasteless and not at all enjoyable to eat.  It had the texture of lamb but no flavor at all, the sauce was quite bland.  The service was excellent and the small bites and dessert quite good.  But places like this as culinary experiences have fallen far behind places like Frevo.  Don’t come for the food, but the experience is great."

Every staff member made us feel special. Our waiter answered every question with a level of professionalism that comes with years of trained knowledge.

For anyone that has an event to celebrate this is your place!"

They had several extra little nibbles come out in addition to the ordered courses which was really great.   The food was presented creatively and was delicious.   The flavors were well balanced and the menu offered a broad range of choices.\n\nThe drinks were presented beautifully and were equally delicious.\n\nThe service was outstanding and what I expected at a Michelin star restaurant.   It really makes a big difference to be taken care   of with such care.\n\nThis was the perfect restaurant to bring in a special birthday or other occasion.   Thank you to the team at Daniel for making it very special and I’ll be happy to come back."

The flavors were complex. They came from an unexpected combination of familiar foods with surprising flavors. I'm not pretentious enough to criticize the food. By the end of dinner, Pascal was like family. It was an amazing experience and Chef Daniel is a genius."

The restaurant is beautiful and so elegant.  Service was impeccable!  I ordered the 9-course tasting menu and it was incredible.  The entire evening was truly amazing and the staff was perfection.  I was also given a tour of the kitchen which was so impressive to see everyone in action.  I made one last stop at the bar and had a wonderful drink.  Incredible evening in NYC!"
