            "text": "Never been to this place before even though it is walking distance from my home. Perhaps the fact that they are located in a basement made me overlook this hidden, small, warm and casual place.  My visit was to order hummus and pita to go however, and I left impressed by their menu. The food was delicious. I have eaten in a few Mediterranean places in the area, Yasouvlaki, Ella and Miriam, and let me tell you that this hummus was better. Creamy, tasteful and the right texture. Whenever you are in the Upper West Side, pay them a visit and enjoy.\n\nI will post a full review of the place, other plates, service and atmosphere, when I return for a more formal meal.\n\n“Eat deliciously\""

            "text": "I want to start by saying that my family and I have been \"regulars\" at this place for at least 18 years - it's been our favourite Mediterranean spot food wise despite of rather simple interior - the place where hummus was \"to die for\" and 100% worth a commute from Brooklyn. The owners and staff were like family. It was always a warm, happy and yummy experience - until today.\n\nMy husband and I were so very looking forward to devouring delicious brunch - the usual poached eggs with eggplant for me, and eggplant Shakshuka for him. When we stepped inside the restaurant the first thing we noticed was strange smell inside - almost reminding me of a hospital which was a bit of a turn off but I brushed it off. The place was half empty on a Sunday afternoon which was rather unusual - especially because restaurant right across from it - Miriam - was full to the capacity . I also noticed that staff was COMPLETELY new - no one who we knew from years back was present. When the server arrived he was very neutral, matter of fact, nothing warm or pleasant about him. I placed my order but was already feeling uneasy. When the food arrived, and i started trying my eggs which used to always be amazingly tasty, beautifully complimented by juicy thick slice of eggplant and hummus - I was shocked to realize that eggs tasted mediocre and were far from what I was expecting, and the eggplant - a thin slice of eggplant per egg - was bland and tasteless! And to make things even worse, the  food arrived BARELY WARM - almost cold! The taste was 2/10 - just unbelievable! The hummus was excellent - but that was one tiny part of the large platter which was pretty much inedible! It is because of hummus I rated my experience as 2 and not 1! And side salad was all leaves - I have no idea what that even was!\n\nAnd so in summary:\n- both eggs - bland, cheap eggs hands down, no taste whatsoever.\n- Eggplant - undercooked, tasteless, barely present.\n- Food temperature - inappropriately cold further affecting the taste.\n- Service-  below average.\n\nI am baffled because I don't know the reason behind such disappointing experience - perhaps ownership has changed or the chef  -  I can only keep guessing ... but it is definitely a big difference and a huge disappointment."

Even though our waitress wasn't an example of great service, literally handed us napkins and spray to clean the table as we got seated, we didn't let it ruin our experience. Surrounded by friendly folks, the sun took the spotlight, officially marking its territory as brunch heaven. I opted for the Mallawach dish that won me over at $20 – an edible treasure trove. My boyfriend went for the Shakshuka thrill at $18 – eggs and spice galore. Each bite was full of flavor. Healthy and affordable –  Free OJ and tea with your entree, what a bonus! NYC's secret culinary gem.\n\nQuick as a New York minute, The Hummus Place is a NYC must!"

This place has some of the best falafel and shakshuka I’ve had!\n\nI highly suggest going for brunch on a weekend as they have some options that come with a combination of several things.\n\nWe got one of their brunch shakshukas (2 eggs in a tomato sauce) as well as a side order of babaganoush (eggplant dip) and falafel (fried chickpea balls).\n\nThe main dish came with sides of salad, hummus, pita, roasted potatoes, orange juice, and your choice of coffee or tea. It is a great value for what you get.\n\nThe hummus is excellent - so smooth and lightly seasoned so you can enjoy the freshness of the ingredients. Paired with pillowy-soft pita, it’s an excellent side.\n\nThe salad is good - nothing too special about it.\n\nRoasted potatoes are good - nothing special about this either.\n\nShakshuka is amazing. The eggs are served over easy, and a generous amount of piping hot and chunky tomato sauce are spread all around. I highly suggest cutting the eggs to let the egg yolk mix with the tomato sauce and cook a little with it. This dish doesn’t have too many spices as you are really supposed to enjoy the simple flavors of the eggs and tomatoes.\n\nThe falafel was excellent. Some of the best falafel I have had. So soft and moist on the inside and excellent flavors, including the little sauces they put on the plate itself.\n\nThe babaganoush was good. Nothing to mind blowing from other ones I’ve tried around the city. Personally I don’t think the quality of this that you get is worth the nine dollars that you pay.\n\nIn the end, this was an excellent restaurant to enjoy some really good food. I definitely recommended if you are in the area!"

            "text": "This place surprised me when I first time came here to have a Mediterranean dinner even though everything was vegetarian! It was sooo good! We ordered Hummus; cauliflower, beet salad, and roasted eggplant!\n\nHowever, the second time here, the brunch smoked salmon was not good enough though - I DON'T recommend ordering it; My Friend said the roasted eggplant one was good though.\n\nWould recommend it here for a healthy Mediterranean meal!!"

            "text": "Hummus Place gives Mamouns a run for their money.\n\nTheir falafel sandwich was 🤌. They layer the ingredients in the sandwich which makes for great bites. The hummus gets wrapped around on the inside of the pita, then they add veg salad, dressing, sauces and falafel pieces and repeat until the sandwich is full.\n\nThe pita - so soft and fluffy - I personally really liked the whole wheat and couldn’t tell a huge difference.\n\nThe falafel - very green (which I tend to think is a good thing, more herbs, flavorful), soft and not very fried; they also pack them in nicely and don’t skimp which makes it great in every bite as initially mentioned\n\nThe sauces - fire. It’s like a blend of a few - a dressing for the chopped tomato and cucumber, tahini, a green sauce and hummus. Makes it so flavorful and moist.\nThe veg add a nice subtle crunch and health.\n\nI ordered mine with mixed green salad which I would recommend for one person unless you’re splitting a pita sandwich with someone in which fries may help get you both full.\n\nVery much so recommend this spot. I am definitely planning to come back"

I am going this place at least every month I feel like. The only criticism I’d state is, I wish they have a normal size of glass for orange juice, it is coming in a tiny glass."

            "text": "Accidentally, I found this place on my way from the American Museum of Natural History. I consider myself to be fond of Mediterranean cuisine since the beginning of the pandemic. I should admit that the hummus platter turned out to be quite large for one to deal with, but so amazingly delicious that I paused, only having finished the fourth flavor with mushrooms. I have never thought that someone would supercede the Presidio KEBAB in San Francisco in serving hummus. But the Hummus Place did. Baklava was very good, too, but, subjectively, could be softer."
