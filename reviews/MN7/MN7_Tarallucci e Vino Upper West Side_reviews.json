I walked in without a reservation by myself and was immediately greeted by the hostess Lily, who made me comfortable and brought me to a great table outside (not hiding a single diner in a corner like some other places do). I got a menu and water right away and the waiter Alex was funny and attentive and recommended a rose prosecco that was delicious. The food rounded out the experience - I will definitely be back!"

We went for the early seating and it was relatively quiet on a rainy last day of the year.\n\nAlex, our server, was friendly and was kind enough to offer us a glass of wine on the house, after he felt bad having charged full price for our little one on the Prix Fixe menu.\n\nFood overall was pretty decent. There was a Pappardelle pasta for our little one, and a few great options for meat lovers, including a Rib-eye steak which unfortunately lacked flavor, in spite of adding their rather heavy garlic and heavy cream sauce. The lobster tail was thoroughly enjoyed by the seafood lover on our table, and was enough to knock a person out on the table next to us, who possibly had a shell fish allergy. We were glad to see the person doing fine though, towards the end of the meal. Definitely not a nice way to end the year!\n\nNoise levels were on the average end throughout our time there, and their menu and service were pretty good, definitely on the expensive end though. Will definitely visit again sometime in the near future!"

Every detail of the evening felt seamless and thoughtful, and her positive energy really elevated the entire experience.\n\nIt’s rare to have service that feels both polished and personal, but Martina strikes that balance beautifully.

Carbonara was actually pretty flavorful; but the gnocchi was bland. With all the sauce that was given, it certainly LOOKS like a flavorful dish; but I could barely taste the pesto. I even saved some to take home and season, thinking it may have just been under-seasoned; but it wasn't much better. The texture of the gnocchi itself was decent, which is a positive note. Lastly, take a look at the photo. Does this look like an acceptable amount of pasta for $25 to you? It's not the worst place; but there are much better establishments for dining in the area."

I always choose to sit at the bar and Oscar is beyond welcoming each time (I think he’s mainly there for brunches on the weekend ;) Overall, 10/10 and will continue to come back!"
