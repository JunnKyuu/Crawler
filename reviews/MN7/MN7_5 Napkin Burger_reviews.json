Les cocktails étaient très bons également.\nLe service est irréprochable, l’équipe était aux petits soins avec nous du début à la fin, ce qui rend l’expérience encore plus agréable. Un restaurant que je recommande vivement pour un dîner gourmand à New York !"

Toasting stale bread does that make it  better,  it's a shame that a nice place like this would cheap out on an inexpensive item.,\nUPDATE , they did respond to my complaint which is right on line with the great service we received in the restaurant so I have to guess that my bread problem was just on  a off day.."

It was a tempura shrimp with a soft tortilla shell but that tortilla was hard and kinda stale. The taco is meant to be spicy but I got the spicy sauce on the side due to my battle with acid reflux. The taco left much to desired for $10 for 2 so I would try something different next time. The staff here has always been courteous and accommodating. The wings are my favorite. I wish you could order 2 portion sizes because I wanted more after these were done because they are so tasty.

It wasn’t until the host approached us that anyone said anything, and even then, he admitted he forgot to inform the wait staff we were seated—despite the fact that multiple waiters had already come out to serve other tables around us.\n\nWe sat outside with our dog, and basic service like water was not provided until we asked. When we did ask, the waitress rolled her eyes and dismissed us with, “OK, I’ll be back with your waiter.” No waiter ever came. The only interaction we had was when someone finally dropped off our food and then later brought our drinks—25 minutes after sitting down. Meanwhile, every other table around us received proper, timely service with drinks, food, and water.\n\nThe lack of professionalism and customer care was shocking. Even though we had a horrible experience, we still left a tip—only because of my wife. Personally, I would never return. This chain clearly does not prioritize their customers, and the wait staff was some of the worst I’ve encountered.\n\nI will not be going back."

It wasn’t very crowded during our visit, and the service was decent but nothing special.\n\nThe restaurant’s standout feature is its unusual menu: on one side, classic American burgers and meats, and on the other, sushi a surprising combination for this type of establishment.\n\nAs for the food, it was okay but nothing exceptional. We ordered burgers, fries, and a sushi dish for one of the kids, and the total bill came to around $125 for four people, without alcohol. The price felt a bit steep for what we got.\n\nI’m not sure I’d go back.\n\nFrench -\n\nJ’ai visité ce restaurant avec ma petite amie et ses enfants. L’endroit est assez grand, situé sur Broadway, et ressemble à un sports bar avec des écrans un peu partout. Il y avait peu de monde lors de notre visite, et le service était correct mais sans plus.\n\nLa particularité du restaurant est son menu étonnant : d’un côté, des burgers et viandes typiquement américaines, et de l’autre, des sushis. Une combinaison surprenante pour ce type d’établissement.\n\nCôté nourriture, j’ai trouvé les plats corrects mais sans être exceptionnels. Nous avons commandé des burgers, des frites et un plat de sushis pour un enfant, et l’addition s’élevait à environ 125$ pour 4 personnes, sans alcool. Le rapport qualité-prix m’a semblé un peu élevé.\n\nJe ne suis pas certain d’y retourner."

The cheeseburger sliders were a bit on the too well done side. The spinach artichoke dip was just ok; the chips were not fresh (not stale, just not fresh). For value, I would return again but would try different items or try their lunch menu. Service was great. Aidewalk dining available. Aug 2024"

Burger was delicious; perfectly salted, cheese was high quality, grilled onions paired well, and they use the best pickles. Fries were perfectly salted too. Only downside is that it was slow and they still took quite awhile to complete my simple takeout order."

Ho avuto modo di assaggiare il loro hamburger e le patatine al tartufo e parmigiano. I prezzi sono un po’ più alti della media dei fast food ma ne vale davvero la pena. Consigliato"

And there is something for everyone, whether you want a veggie burger, a beef burger, a fish burger, some other type of burger, or even sushi or a tasty sandwich. Also, they have a nice happy hour deal, with cheap drinks and sliders if that’s your thing. The vegetarian options are decent, and the veggie burger is excellent as well as the sweet potato fries. For the burger aficionado (of whatever variety) this should be a go-to spot in the neighborhood. Also, the server was noticeably friendly."

The server was extremely slow bringing the drinks, some of my party received their food minutes after each other. Many items that were ordered were forgotten and had to wait a while. The turkey burger was very soggy. The French fries were disappointing as they were not crinkled cut as pictured in many reviews. They were. Small hand cut fries over cooked and greasy. The meal was not as enjoyable as I would like. (French fries not pictured as they came extremely late to the table)"
