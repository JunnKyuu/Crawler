We went for dinner yesterday after a long time, and something is off.\n\nThere was no host at the host station on the door, the dining room was almost empty yet service was really slow, the menu is now very limited, and yet when we ordered an appetizer of that list, we were told it was not available. And the food was not prepared well at all (excessive oil and salt).\n\nA shame because we really used to like this place."

The menu itself was very limited and quite different from the one shown online, which advertised many more appealing choices. Overall, it was a disappointing experience."

By 9:10pm, the staff switched on bright lights to basically tell all patrons that they’re already closing.  The atmosphere was like eerie because there were only around 4 tables occupied at 8pm & the place was huge. There was nobody at the bar by 9pm & it’s a Thursday night.

That left us very few choices for us to eat. we had hibachi which was very good And peas on straciatella. They didn’t even have bread! the bread that they did end up bringing us after we complained a few times was hard as a rock. I hope the remodel goes well. I don’t wanna dash this business to bits, but you should not go there until they’re done remodeling mid July.  We left very hungry."

Our waitress was nice and had a genuine attitude of wanting customers to have a positive dining experience... We ordered a starter that never came, and then when our main dishes arrived she apologized and was honest that it was her mistake, and she quickly plugged in the app and let us know when it did arrive it was on the house... The space is big and bright during the day,  and the ceilings do create a lot of sound bouncing about the space, but  big spaces with high ceilings can create a lot of sound amplification so keep that in mind if you are looking for a quiet dining experience... The cocktail I had was well made... The brunch food was only meh at best. The omelet I had was fine, but unmemorable. The small salad that accompanied the dish was bland. My friend complained that her burger was awful. I tried her burger and I think my friend was being overly critical about the burger being awful, but fair to say it was bland... The tarte flambee appetizer that came at the end, which agin was free , we only ate a little of because it was not enjoyable. Trader Joe's sells something similar in a box that you throw in the oven that sadly tastes far better than what we received at our table.... I let the waitress know that in a past life I worked in high end food in NYC and that the kitchen needed to tighten things up, because a restaurant cannot achieve lasting longevity and return customers on mediocre food."

I made a reservation for Christmas Day weeks ago, confirmed it earlier that day, and then at 6:15pm on Christmas Eve, I received a text canceling my reservation because the restaurant isn’t open on Christmas. A text - no phone call, no decency, just a cold, impersonal message less than 24 hours before our planned dinner.\n\nWhen I called to speak to a manager, the hostess was incredibly rude, repeatedly denying my request to speak to anyone in charge and passing me around. After calling back, I was finally connected to a manager named David, who claimed he was “caught off guard,” didn’t know anything about the situation, and promised to call me back in 20 minutes. He never did.\n\nTo make matters worse, they blamed Resy, but Resy confirmed in an email that restaurants control their own availability. This mistake is 100% on The Milling Room. And let’s not forget, they charge $35 per person if I cancel within 24 hours, but they can cancel on me at the last minute via text, ruin holiday plans, and offer zero accountability?\n\nThis level of unprofessionalism, especially at Christmas, is appalling. The Milling Room tries to present itself as a high-end restaurant, but this experience clearly demonstrates otherwise. They’ve completely lost my trust and my business."

It has cute little bar right next to the entrance and there is a semi-dark hallway that leads to main space which is pleasantly spacious and equipped with half-clear high-ceiling. I got significant impression as if I’m guided to open space and I think this is probably what makes experience from this restaurant the most unique one. It was very nice.\n\nI enjoyed my foods too and would have certainly not 5 stared the place if food experience was anything negative. First time trying gnocchi and the texture was such a new experience to me. Overall it gave me impression that foods here are high quality and I would love to try their other menu sometime, although not again the same combination of the 2 menus I already tried cause both are somewhat on the greesy side so not a good pair to each other.\n\n입구에는 귀여운 바가 찰싹 붙어있고 그 앞으로는 조금 어둑어둑한 통로가 나있는데, 그곳을 지나면 반투명의 높은 천장이 맞이해주는 레스토랑 메인 공간이 나옵니다. 그 열려있는 공간으로 나가는 듯한 전체적인 레이아웃이 굉장히 인상적이었고 너무 근사하다는 생각이 들었어요. 날씨 좋은 어느날에 브런치로 와도 정말 좋을 것 같아요."

The aroma is intoxicating, and it tastes superb. All in all, it's one of the best, if not the best, steak I have ever had.  Complimented by romantic setting and the professional staff.

What a wonderful dinner I had with my family. The service was impeccable. Our server was so knowledgeable about the menu and took his time to explain each dish that we were curious about. The staff is excellent! Moussa the manager made sure we were well taken care of and came to our table multiple times to ask us if we needed anything else. The cocktails and food were absolutely delicious! The Chef Florian Hugo did an amazing job bringing wonderful fall flavors to the new menu. I highly recommend the Besos Caliente cocktail, the Tomato Feuillete appetizer, the prime striploin steak and the bourbon apple tart for dessert! If you’re looking for delicious French fine dining the Milling room will exceed your expectations! Absolutely fantastic 5 stars!"

Happy hour is in the front at the bar, the menu is solid and the bartenders are always on their A game. Dinner is in their majestic, large dining room in the back and is one of the most visually appealing places to dine in the city (in my humble opinion).\n\nFor happy hour, get yourself a $10 cocktail and pair it with their burger and fries combo. The cocktail is super high quality and a great deal considering that an equivalent elsewhere runs for $15 or higher. The burger is up there with the greats. Will def back back here many more times."

Next, I tried the grilled octopus. It was solid. My main was the squid ink pasta with gulf shrimp. It was 10/10. So delicious! I closed with the bread pudding which was a lovely sweet ending.

            "text": "Had a lovely dinner at The Milling Room. It’s a beautiful space with very nice ambiance and history (previously the Endicott Hotel).\n\nFor appetizers we had the grilled octopus and the market salad. Both were delicious. The octopus was so tender and the sauces were very flavorful and balanced. The salad was simple but perfect.\n\nFor entrees I had the roasted chicken and my husband had the squid ink pasta. The chicken was… next level. I’ve never had such a juicy chicken breast before. The skin was so crispy and delicious. The potato purée was perfectly smooth and velvety, and the leek fondue was so fresh.\n\nThe squid ink pasta was incredible. It was one of those dishes where you take your first bite then your eyes go wide. It was a perfect pasta dish - garlicky and also had calabrian chili oil for a little kick.\n\nFor dessert we had cappuccinos and the berry vacherin. It was fresh and light, exactly how I wanted to end the meal. The pistachio crème brûlée and the banana sticky toffee pudding sounded amazing too. I’ll need to save more room for dessert next time!\n\nLastly, staff were all highly professional and prompt, from the hostess to the server to the busser. I also noticed there was a sommelier so I’m sure they take their wine list seriously. We will definitely be back with friends and family in tow!"

            "text": "We got married at The Milling Room on 11/13/221. I debated not writing this review because I want to keep how amazing this space is a secret for just me. We were looking for a venue that was big enough for 90-100 people but still small and intimate, a place that could fit a dance floor but didn't feel huge, rustic but chic, and The Milling Room fits all of this. Hannah is badass- she was on top of everything the night of the wedding, throughout COVID changes, and throughout the 1.5 years leading up to our wedding day for everything else. The space barely needs any additional decoration because it's already decorated so perfectly as is. We had our ceremony right in the space at the fireplace/mantle. If you've been here for brunch or dinner, you know the cocktails, food, and dessert are already slamming, the bar itself is gorgeous. All we needed to do was add some candles and \"moody fall\" flowers as the chef's kiss for our wedding. And on top of all of this, it's affordable. We feel so lucky to have gotten married here."

The interior is a wonderful sight, probably better to go in the daytime where there's sunlight because at night it was pretty dim.  The restaurant extends pretty deep with a bar near the entrance. Pleasant meal, walked away satisfied."

            "text": "The Milling Room is such a lovely restaurant in UWS. I love the beautiful, open, spacious dining area.\n\nI came for brunch with a friend and we had a very comfortable dining experience, with their large tables spaced out nicely and high ceilings. At many other restaurants in the city, tables are right next to each other, so we really liked how the tables were spread out and we could enjoy a conversation without having to yell over other voices.\n\nI ordered the Creamy Risotto ($21+), with asparagus, English peas, fava beans and parmigiano. It had a poached egg on top, which was nice. The dish itself was a bit bland, though. I would recommend asking for extra parmesan.\n\nI would love to make this one of my go-to brunch spots, but will need to find a dish I really like."

My dad had a pasta dish and it was fine, not good. We went during the week day so it was pretty empty, but it’s a big restaurant so there was actually a lot of people. It felt empty tho. It’s good for what it is, but I didn’t walk away feeling like that was a great meal."
