            "text": "I must have come on an off night. The hostess (not the one with glasses) was the rudest person I’ve ever encountered. She seemed bothered when I asked if they had space for one at the bar. She then berated a couple who moved spots so they didn’t have to be in front of the bartenders splashing theatrics and waitstaff congregating at the host stand.\nThe wait staff seemed like they were huddled in the front, back, everywhere but doing nothing.\nIt was ten minutes before they took my order. The order was out not two minutes later by someone wearing rubber gloves. (Clearly a food runner?… which makes zero sense considering the amount of waitstaff and size of the place.)\nThe food came out cold and flavorless and not one person asked if I needed anything or asked how my meal was the entire time.\nI set a timer and it took 8 min for the bar back to ask me if I needed anything. He then spent five minutes trying to find the waitress. She held up the screen to check out and again didn’t ask how everything was.\nThe service was so bad I couldn’t even bring myself to tip.\nThe only person actually working was the food runner and the bar back.\nAs someone who worked In hospitality consulting, the chaos of this place was mesmerizing. The service could have offset the food or vice versa but on this occasion Canto UWS fell short across the board."

Our server was fantastic, came here from Italy, (we spoke Italian for a bit) and was attentive while not being overbearing.\nLovely carbonara, served in a way I have never seen before (with an in tact yolk on top). The rest of the family enjoyed their meal as well. We all had pasta dishes and were quite pleased (Gnocchi, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Penne with Butter and Cheese, the last 2 for the kids).\nIt was fashionable, but not overly so, with everything from jeans and tee shirts to fancy/club/dress up.\nPrices were reasonable. You get what you pay for...\nThe ricotta cheesecake was ok, not as moist a version as I hoped for, but with a fun brulee top.\nAll in all. Would go again and again. Really great experience for all."

            "text": "My friend and I planned on visiting Canto on the upper west side for quite some time. I'm a regular at the original Canto in the west village because I fell in love with one of their house specials one night I visited.\n\nWhen we arrived, we chose to sit outside because the weather was nice and we're almost in the season where it's about to get cooler. Paola introduced herself to us and was incredibly polite as well as patient while we tried to figure out what we wanted to order. We started off with drinks.\n\nAs usual, I'm a double bourbon neat, and my friend chose a martini. After a few sips, we decided to order. I kept it simple with the Bistecca (Skirt Steak), roasted potatoes and an arugula salad. My friend was in the mood for some pasta so she ordered the Veal meatballs in tomato sauce. Both our dishes were nothing short of amazing. My friend devoured her meal in minutes. For desert, we decided to share a Ricotta Cheesecake with a vanilla gelato and strawberries. We both melted after the first bite.\n\nCanto has always been one of my favorite restaurants, but now that they have their second location closer to home, I will be visiting a lot more often. Paola was an amazing host and took care of every request we had. Canto is definitely on my top 5 list of restaurants to go to in NYC."

Small in size but strong in liquor and espresso, and the mascarpone/baileys foam was lovely. Really good drink! $19 but worth it! That being said-- if it were $15 or less I would have had more than one! Something to think about for sales! The carbonara was pretty good, but my husband got the veal meatball spaghetti and WOOOW. I highly recommend that dish! The carbonara was average in comparison. Cozy darker vibes which I personally prefer, beautiful building. Excellent service. Bread toasted nicely and red sauce with ricotta comes with bread service! Thank you"

Also, it gets busy on weekends so I’d recommend making a reservation. They luckily had outdoor seating. We came a long way to try this place and I hadn’t thought it was a fancy Italian place. The manager found us a table outside and told us we could have the table for an hour. Service was great despite the hectic dinner rush. The food was probably unexpected but some of the best food I’ve tried in the city. I’d definitely come back. They had a special menu we both ordered off of. I can’t believe I’ve never heard of this place. My friend sent me the viral dog ig reel but it’s filmed in an empty restaurant that looks like a diner so we weren’t sure what to expect. Great spot for girls night or date night. My husband got the halibut and so got the crab fettuccine. Also the frito misto and kale salad. The frito misto sauce is a bit peppery."

We had a round of drinks , the cocktail menu is creative and looks delicious and they also have a great mocktail menu. We had the Pick Up\nLine and The Valentina for drinks. For Apps we had the Cesar salad ( I’ve been once before this time and tuna tartare is also amazing.) For entrees we did a steak and two pastas - Lobster Ravioli and Tagliatelle Bolognese both were delicious- would highly recommend both especially the ravioli. Steak was cooked perfectly and came with a side of truffle fries that were also really good. We were stuffed after this meal. The owner Jamel, was really nice and welcoming - he came over to our table a few times to check on us and even bought us a special dessert. I would recommend for a date night or a night out with the girls. The atmosphere is curated beautifully and the decor is chic. We went to the upper west side location. I will absolutely be back."

The oysters looked clams they were so tiny I won’t be back."

The entire staff is truly very friendly & attentive!\n\nI come for the Happy hour oysters and Frozen Espresso Martinis , I ask for mine with Tequila.\n\nSome feed back: i’ve gotten the oysters a few times & whoever is shucking them should be a little more careful as every oyster always has small pieces of shell.  Oysters are delicious just be careful not to swallow any shell.\n\nSide note: the west village location told me you do not have the tequila option for frozen, which is not true. I have some friends who regularly go to this location & told me they get tequila instead of vodka all the time. I had no issues requesting tequila at the UWS location\n\nHighly recommend, cannot wait to try more food options here."
