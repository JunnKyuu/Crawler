He had excellent recommendations, was very attentive and considerate (e.g., asking if we had to leave by a certain time), and even made the meal more special by giving me a complimentary dessert because we were celebrating. The food was delicious. Highly recommend the grilled chicken, burrata truffle corn salad, creme brulee, and blueberry cast iron pancake! I would love to return again after today's experience! The ambience is so elegant as well. Perfect for groups, dates, and celebrations!"

The au poivre sauce for the steak was gooey- clearly using corn starch. Barely average food but at the incredible price of 450+ absolute highway robbery. It’s also just cookie cutter decor from the chain restaurant manual."

The vibe is super cozy and stylish, and the staff make you feel so welcome from the second you walk in.\n\nThe food was incredible, every dish was full of flavor and beautifully presented. You can really tell they care about quality. I tried the Short Rib Cavatelli , and it was honestly perfection.\n\nThe drinks were just as good — creative, well-balanced, and served with such great presentation. My server was friendly, attentive, and gave great recommendations, which made the whole night even better.\n\nOverall, The Consulate is the perfect mix of great food, great service, and great atmosphere. I’ll definitely be coming back soon and bringing friends with me!"

Susanna set us at a table and informed us that they were going to host an event , that we had  a time table to enjoy , then, suddenly,  this manager  brutally interrupted  us, kicking us to another table, to make a long story short, when we left, there was no one in the table she said would be occupied, all that for what? Just to humiliate the staff or to make the customers uncomfortable? We didn’t get the point.\nWe started paying attention to her,  and the way she was talking to these staffs was kind scary, intimidating, we could tell by their face how terrified they were, due to a toxic work environment. It’s not about the customers wellbeing anymore, it’s solely abt numbers.\nIt’s first time I witnessed a such thing and wanted to share it, my niece said this is the best way, reviewing it and speaking up. We cant normalize moral harassment at work.\nIt’s the first we’re doing reviews and it’s more than necessary  ion order to open the others customers eyes."

We ate a variety of French and New American dishes (escargots, Caesar salad, a burger, grilled fish, lots of seasonal vegetables) from their menu and really enjoyed it all. Great service, comfy booths and quiet enough for good conversation. Good for date night or entertaining."

I’d go back if I lived in the area and wanted something familiar that didn’t require planning in advance since reservations were easy.\nWe caught them on a live jazz night; the band was great!\nWe had the wagyu sirloin special over stir fried veggies in teriyaki, a mushroom truffle flatbread and grilled artichoke app. All were flavorful and well prepared.\nThe staff was friendly and accommodating but we found ourselves flagging people down to get service."

I’ve been many times for dinner or happy hour and they have a great selection of classics. Some of my favorites are the cavatelli, muscles and the burger. Also, don’t miss the happy hour. They have great little bites on that menu! The staff is always super nice and accommodating – shout out to Mark, the bartender for his incredible service and attention to detail. I’ll continue to come back to the spot over and over again."

Upon entering, I was attracted by the retro style - it feels atmospheric and cozy, especially suitable for enjoying a leisurely time with family and friends💓. My favorite is the French Onion Soup🧅; the cheese can be stretched so long, and the soup is fragrant with onions and has a hint of sweetness😋.\n\nThe Salmon Eggs Benedict has a smooth and tender texture, also a must-select for brunch.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the Short Rib Cavatelli💓; the ribs are stewed until tender and flavorful, paired with cavatelli which is very soft and delicate in texture, highly recommended👍."

She made excellent recommendations, including the amazing Steak and Eggs. Julia was so attentive that she even took our order herself, which was a huge time-saver on a busy Sunday morning. We also had the pleasure of meeting Medina, the manager, who was so gracious and appreciative of our feedback. I highly recommend The Consulate for a truly exceptional dining experience!"

            "text": "The restaurant’s design is beautiful—modern yet cozy—and the festive atmosphere on Christmas Day made for a lively vibe. It was packed, which speaks to its popularity.\nAs for the food, I ordered the Roasted Branzino, which came with cilantro sauce and shaved fennel. The texture of the fish was spot on—perfectly cooked and flaky—but unfortunately, it lacked depth of flavor. It could have used a little more seasoning, perhaps some black pepper or additional spices, to elevate the dish. The cilantro sauce didn’t quite complement the fish the way I had hoped, and the overall taste just didn’t wow me. My husband went with the 8oz Filet Mignon, which was served with mashed potatoes and bordelaise sauce. It didn’t have that wow factor either.\nWe decided to skip dessert, as we weren’t overly excited after the main course. Overall, the ambiance was great, but the food didn't quite meet expectations. A solid choice, but not outstanding."
