I ordered the three mezze plate, and the bread it came with was incredibly fresh—a must for dipping.\n\nI chose the marinated beets, the matbucha, and feta. All of them were excellent, but the beets really stood out; the horseradish yogurt was a fantastic touch and paired with the roasted chickpeas it elevated the whole dish.\n\nFinished with the panna cotta which if you're a fan of rose water, you will love it. Overall, a great find and a fantastic meal!"

Service was equally friendly, attentive, and professional throughout the meal.\n\nUnfortunately, the chicken schnitzel fell short, with a rubbery texture that made it less enjoyable and the salad was overly salty. On a positive note, the bread was absolutely amazing and fresh, flavorful, and a highlight of the meal.\n\nOverall, while there were some hits and misses with the food, the great service and ambiance make it a place I’d consider giving another try."

Service was very attentive and the servers were professional, personable, and responsive. In a neighborhood of Mediterranean restaurants, Dagon is an UWS cornerstone. Don’t miss it."

We had a large group that split the mezze sampler, kubaneh (so good), octopus (fine, but the rice cake is really spicy), cigar, shishbarak (my actual favorite), brisket, sabich flatbread, silan halva dessert (really good but really sweet), and the cheesecake. Looking forward to coming back for Brunch."

Dagon has a casual vibe with a sophisticated atmosphere.  The bartenders were both incredibly attentive but Delaney was the one who handled the majority of my ordering and she was fantastic. Dagon has extended the restaurant week menu which was a bonus. The Israeli/Mediterranean menu has so many options. If you are on the UWS or not Dagon is well worth a visit. Also a fantastic wine and drinks list. I am looking forward to my next visit and explore the regular menu."

So good. Highly recommend. Our server, Ron, was incredible. Super attentive, was able to answer our questions, and was spot on with portion size for plate sharing in my party. Would definitely eat here again."

They brought our golden retriever a bowl of water for our pleasant outdoor half booth. Lovely experience! We had the kubaneh, eggplant mezze, Israeli salad, and the flatbread. The chamomile tea and Bloody Mary were also on point!"
