It’s been over a week a no reply nor any gift card. Changed my review from a 2 to a 1 due to this disrespect and horrible customer service.\n\nI used to love this place and would come pretty often, but lately it’s just not the same. The food still tastes good, I’ll give them that, but everything else has taken a hit.\n\nMe and my fiancée ordered our usual: two Smith burgers and calamari. The calamari portion was super small, like an appetizer for one, which was disappointing. The burgers were flavorful like always, but the buns were dry and hard, definitely not fresh. It kind of killed the whole thing.\n\nWhat really did it for me, though, was the service. The staff came off kind of rude, and the manager was nowhere to be found when we needed help. He eventually came by and tried to assist, but by then we were already over it. We just wanted to leave.\n\nAfter years of being a loyal customer, I think this might be it for me. It sucks because this used to be my go-to spot. Now I guess I’m on the hunt for a new burger place."

When my friends arrived, we were taken to our seats in another very large room. Our servers must have been new as they were reaching over us to place our plates. Food arrived cold. Instructions were ignored and food had to be sent back.\nAs the room filled up, it was harder to hear.\nThe restaurant gets high marks for its location. We had just a short walk to the theater.  The food was good when they finally got it right."

In our latest visit there, Cat was our server and she was so kind and personable that it made our experience way above and beyond. She was THE BEST. We even made sure the manager knew how great she was! It was a lively restaurant, more so than the other we’d been to, but it was not overly loud or obnoxious. It was a terrific experience. You will love it!! We’ll definitely make it one of our destinations for future visits!"

            "text": "I had high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the worst experiences of my entire trip to New York.\nThe main issue was the overwhelming noise level throughout our meal. The restaurant was so loud that my companion and I couldn’t have a proper conversation. Every attempt to communicate was drowned out by the constant commotion around us.\nThe seating arrangement was extremely poor. We were placed just twenty centimeters away from the adjacent table, leaving us with virtually no personal space. Even worse, my companion’s seat was positioned so close to the table that she had difficulty getting out of her chair—the table was practically wedged against the seat.\nDuring our forty-minute dinner, we had to endure constant noise from the kitchen area and an employee cleaning silverware just three meters away from our table. The clattering of dishes being washed and plates repeatedly falling to the floor created a relentless backdrop of noise and disruption that made dining nearly impossible.\nWhile the food deserves credit for being decent (2/5), it simply couldn’t compensate for the overall terrible atmosphere and lack of consideration for customer comfort. I would not recommend this restaurant and advise future visitors to look elsewhere for a more pleasant dining experience."

LILY ignored us right after check-in and turned to chat with another hostess instead. A little later, she briefly told us to wait “a minute or two,” but we ended up waiting almost 30 minutes while watching her seat several groups who arrived after us.\n\nBy noon, our toddler was getting very hungry, so I asked another hostess for help. She checked the system and asked whether we had checked in, I told her we had, with LILY, and had already been waiting for nearly half an hour. Thankfully, a gentleman with glasses noticed the situation and kindly seated us right away. LILY stood nearby and acted as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe whole experience felt dismissive and disrespectful, honestly, it came across as racial discrimination. It completely ruined what should have been a pleasant brunch. I really hope the management takes this seriously and looks into how their front desk staff treats guests."

The reservation was easily made with OpenTable.\n\nEach location of this establishment boasts a unique ambiance, blending modern design with classic elements - a nod to old-school New York.\n\nUpon entering, the interior is characterized by open layouts, communal tables, and a lively atmosphere, making it suitable for everyone. We were greeted by the host and got a table in a private room usually held for special events.\n\nTheir menu features a variety of classic American dishes, emphasizing fresh, locally sourced ingredients.\n\nAs an appetizer, we opted for the Mac & Cheese and Crispy Calamari. As a main meal, we decided on Avocado Toast and a French Dip Sandwich accompanied by Fries. Complimentary sourdough bread with salted butter and one bottle of spring water and one of sparkling water started our meal.\n\nThe Mac and Cheese served in a mini skillet was phenomenal. The cheese was dripping, and the noodles were perfectly chewy, with the top having that crust, too. The food was fresh, well-prepared, and perfectly portioned. The cost didn’t break the wallet. We had the pleasure of having Adonis as our server, and the service was quick. He was fantastic and would check on us.\n\nThis place provides satisfaction."

The server explained there was a “year difference,” but what was actually brought was the Chappellet Mountain Cuvée — a completely different wine at a much lower tier and price point.\n\nI asked them to discount it at least but my server insisted the price was firm after asking the manager. A $40 bottle should have been $100-120 tops. I still left a nice cash tip to not embarrass the waitress more than necessary.\n\nI’m sure you understand how this feels misleading, especially at a premium price level. If the Signature was unavailable, transparency would have been appreciated so I could make an informed choice rather than being served a different product under the assumption it was equivalent."

We had a reservation for breakfast and I’m glad we did cause despite arriving at opening, seats began quickly getting filled here. The interior is great, a nod to old school New York. The outside, where we sat, was nice as well. They were very accommodating of our dog by bringing him a water bowl and the outdoor dining area is well staffed. The service is good too. We ordered pretty quick and the food also came out quick as well. Here’s how the food was:\n\nWe started off with a mac and cheese, which may sound crazy but man was it the right decision. The mac and cheese was phenomenal, cheese dripping and noodles perfectly chewy. The top had that crust too, just great. We also ordered the french toast and it was good as well. The bread was thick and soft, the caramelized bananas were a bit sweet though so we ate it without to balance out the flavor. The Benedict Johnny was good, the cornbread sweet and savory.The chicken sausage was good and the poached egg added a good texture to things and a bit more flavor. We also grabbed a cappuccino that was frothy and well made. The food altogether was very good and we were happily surprised with the quality of everything. Even though it was on the pricier side of things, we would definitely come back if we’re ever in the area."

We had the pleasure of having Justin R as our server, he was fantastic and recommended a wonderful cocktail, the Cucumber Loco (tequila drink).

            "text": "I'm so glad we came here for lunch on our anniversary on July 15th. This was by far the best restaurant we've been to in New York City. We over-ordered a bit, but it was worth it.\n\nBecause we had a reservation, there was no wait time. The server (wish I recalled his name, our check number was #100), was superb. He checked on us often and made us feel appreciated and valued (unlike our experience at Lucali the day prior).\n\nWe started with the shrimp cocktail ($19 but so worth it) and a new Chips and Dip item they apparently just added to the menu. A small side of veggies came with the appetizers.\n\nI went boujee with my drink order and had the Lunch IPA from Maine Beer Company, hey, we were celebrating 25 years. :)\n\nMy wife ordered a salad and I had the French Dip, both were absolutely delicious and perfect-portioned. I ordered a shot of espresso to combat the food comma I was in. To our surprise, the manager comp'd a delicious pudding dessert with a candle on it, apparently something they are well-known for - it was AWESOME! I'm not a huge pudding fan (I'm a chocoholic), but I'll definitely order that again when we visit again.\n\nOver all, our experience was the perfect 25th Anniversary lunch that we'll remember forever."

            "text": "We came here for brunch today. It wasn’t our first time dining here—we’ve had The Smith burger before, and since we were in the mood for a burger again, we decided to come back.\nWe know the burger portions are huge, and it comes with either French fries or a salad. We usually go for the fries—they're perfectly crispy, and they give you a generous portion. The burger was delicious as always. We ordered the meat medium-rare, and it was just right—juicy and flavorful. My boyfriend found it a bit salty, but I actually like it that way, so I wasn’t disappointed.\nWe skipped appetizers but couldn’t resist dessert. We originally wanted to get their s’mores in a jar, as usual, but unfortunately, it wasn’t on the menu today. Instead, we went with the buttermilk pancakes, which were absolutely delicious—fluffy and not overly sweet. The pecan maple butter was the perfect touch. If you ever see the s’mores on the menu, I’d highly recommend trying them!\nFor drinks, we each had a beer with our burgers and coffee with pancakes—everything was satisfying.\nService was good and fast; they brought out bottles of still and sparkling water right away.\nThe ambiance is okay, but the only downside was the noise level. It was so loud that I could barely hear our waitress, and it was tough to have a conversation."

            "text": "We visited one of the several The Smith restaurant locations at Lincoln Square. It was middle of the week, Wednesday, somewhere before 6pm. It already was filled with customers but we got lucky to have a table without any waiting. Casual atmosphere was very inviting and friendly. And in one hour the place was fully packed. The menu list done in dark color with tiny little white letters and it made me hard to read it. A helpful server gave us some suggestions and we picked up BLUE CHEESE WEDGE and BLACK TRUFFLE ARANCINI as starters and DUCK FRITES for main dish offered as a special on Wednesday. Table gets one bottle of spring and one of sparkling water and 2 pieces of freshly baked sourdough bread with salted butter as a complement which is nice. This order was more than enough for two people. The salad was sprinkled with a lot of sliced onions, lacking sauce and was not really enjoyable. ARANCINI was made from a delicious risotto, formed as fried balls, had creamy and cheesy consistency with the crunchy crust on the top with very flavorful sauce.  We loved them. DUCK FRITES were two duck thighs cooked until tender and served with rich creamy white sauce and I believe which had a horseradish notes in it. The duck was coming with nicely done fries. Cut the piece of duck, deep in the sauce and you will enjoy it until the last bite. If it will happen to dine on Wednesday I highly recommend you to try this great entire.\nBe aware that the tables inside the restaurant are located very close to each other and conversations among the guests creates a lot of noise so if you are looking for more intimacy maybe this place is not a good fit.\nOverall it was a great experience, tasty dinner and I’m definitely coming back."

It looked super busy, so we weren't sure if we would get in, but we were seated right away. Our waiter, Travis, was fantastic! So friendly and attentive. Actually, the entire staff was attentive! When our water bottle was empty, it was immediately refilled. Travis let us know when our food order was put in with the kitchen, and we didn't wait long at all. Go on Sunday and get the chicken parm special! You will not regret it! It tasted amazing, was cooked perfectly, and was absolutely worth the 5-Star review. I highly recommend!!"

While the price was higher due to the special occasion, every dish was delicious and perfectly suited for the holiday. I visited with a guest, and it felt like a great choice to provide a memorable dining experience."

We started with two wonderful appetizers the roasted tomato soup and black truffle arancini. We then moved on to the steak and The Smith Burger. Both were prepared to our liking and the French fries and roasted squash sides were satisfying. We finished with the very tasty sticky toffee pudding and apple tart. Yes it was a good night at The Smith."

They definitely had a hint of smoky pepper taste, but were a little gummy.     Snap pea salad was very good and shrimp were cooked well. Burger was good and fries were nice and crispy. Overall a solid restaurant with a large menu. Will definitely return to try some more items."

I didn’t think we would be getting seating after we went to see the Nutcracker at Lincoln Center - right across the way- but there was a whole back area and we were seated within 3-5 mins with a packed house! We had some drinks, the calamari was outstanding, I loved the selections for oysters and the entrees were also very delicious! Would highly recommend and plan to go back!"

Conveniently located directly across the street from Lincoln Center and The Metropolitan Opera, it was the perfect spot to hit before our concert. The wait staff were superb, The short rib pasta, the chicken milanese, and sticky toffee pudding were excellent. Nice drink menu and wine list as well. Can't wait to go back! Make a reservation!"
