La maravillosa atención de la mesera desde que llegas para servirte el café caliente, humeante ahora si como se dice: tipo americano, fue el starter para estimular el apetito matutino.\nComo ya teníamos el tiempo medido, no pudimos probar extras y nos fuimos directo al plato fuerte.\nLos Waffles descomunales, esponjosos y crocante en su superficie, aunado a la exquisita miel de Maple que sirven ahí dieron por servido la porción de calorías dulces de ese horario (solamente, hay que aclarar).\nHuevo revuelto con tomate y eneldo una combinación no común, pero exquisita fue el atracón que me puse yo. Mi colega se atascó con unos hotcakes, huevos revuelto y crocante tocino.\nMe quedé con ganas de probar el Apple crumble y cerezas rojas,que estaba a la entrada en la vitrina que funciona como refrigerador natural por la baja temperatura que había en la calle.\nHay que volver. Me pasaría un par de semanas en cada lugar y me convertiría en su Cliente cautivo.\nNew York #eslaonda\nLa cocina es definitivamente toda #homeMade"

It made us feel relaxed.  We are and we talked a lot . She was very attentive and patient with us.  My lunch was so much I took some of it home. Thank you sweet lady.

It was as if he didn’t even want to wait on our table. It took a while to get his attention to even place our orders. And when the food came, not ONCE did he come by and ask how everything was and if we needed anything. Yet he kept waiting on the other two tables beside us and took the table next to us’ order way sooner than he had with us. We had to ask who I believe was the hostess, for condiments and the check. Our waiter didn’t even make eye contact with us, which I thought was very rude (and that’s coming from someone who used to be a waitress).\n\nAs for the food, my friend and I ordered the Astoria Omelette and Provençal Omelette which were good - nothing crazy.\n\nI don’t know if I’d come back here for the sole purpose of the terrible service."

We chose a Turkey club sandwich and a feta salad with grilled chicken, coffee, tea and strawberry milkshake and carrot cake which was the best I have ever tasted. Everything was lovely and fresh. It was obviously a popular place as there was a constant stream of customers and delivery drivers collecting orders.\nDefinitely worth a visit if your in the area."

My dining partner and I usually order the same dishes and it has been consistently delicious. Our go to is the stacked pancakes (sweet) and corned beef hash with eggs (savory). The stacked pancakes are made with a mix of flour and cornmeal. The strawberry butter spread and topped with Vermont syrup makes the pancake stacks undeniably delicious! It has actually inspired us to look for a cornmeal pancake recipe and we have replicated this dish, but as strawberry pancakes. The strawberry butter is still something we need to attempt to make. The corned beef hash is definitely homemade, filled with chunks of thick meat. My dining partner would also order the lumberjack because of the thick cut bacon. The bacon has an even amount of meat and fat, with the sweetness and savory taste to it. I have only dined here during brunch time, weekdays and weekends. The place does get packed during popular times, which we try to avoid dining in those times. Since outdoor dining has become a thing, their square footage has increased, accommodating more diners. The cup of brewed coffee is delicious and with free refills. There is a trend in NYC restaurants that do not offer compliments of refills and you can amplify your jitters with a cup or three in this restaurant ! The service is attentive and can get European when they are busy, but the atmosphere is inviting to chat with your dining partner as you wait for your meal."

The bacon is really thick cut, so ordering it \"crisp\" produces something with the consistency of shoe leather.  Also, while the waffles looked scrumptious, they were a little too thick and dense.  There's more to making a really good waffle than just pouring pancake batter into a waffle iron.\n\nThe food was definitely \"good enough to eat\", but with a little work, it could be even better."

The freshest tasting thing on my plate were the eggs. The fries tasted like they were refired while the sausage tasted old. All in all safe yourself the trip and pick a different place."

            "text": "Quint place. Cool area. Most of the food was good. Shank steak was ok. Bland. Salsa was bitter and did not add to the taste. Daughter liked the mac'n'cheese. Son liked the burger. Rest was ok. Where this really fell down was the service. New guy or not...he HAS to do more than poor water for his guests. My order wasn't put in so I ate while the rest watched. Salad came just before main course. Server never checked in on us...not once and when ready to pay...no where to be found. Another server had to come help. We were there around 6 on Saturday but the place was not busy. There are lots of options for food on this stretch of the area. I'd try somewhere else based on this experience...owner/manager came by and had a chance to try to make things right.... didn't discount or give us anything as compensation...even after he was told about the experience.....guess he didn't care either....won't be back"
