The gazpacho was perfectly executed, nice acidity light flavorful. I had the chicken Parmesan with the Jr. portion of pasta. The mini dollop of ricotta was a nice touch although I definitely had issues with the portion size. The chicken itself was nicely seasoned, but wasn’t exactly the most tender piece of chicken I’ve ever had in a restaurant in a Parmesan.\nWe enjoyed the fries, those were well dine and the aioli was tasty.\nThe cocktails we had were not memorable in either presentation or taste and thus no pics of the drinks.  The environment was loud  and it was busy and the wait staff seemed to be having a low energy day. It is a fairly large restaurant with mezzanine seating. Overall, It was ok. I would have loved more attentive service and slightly bigger portions of pasta in the parmesan dish."

Its everything you'd expect from a chain restaurant; consistent, tasty food, and refreshing decor at every place! Service was a little slow at this location and our server wasn't that attentive, but that did not affect our experience at all.\n\nZucchini \"Fries\" ($15) is a must order appetizer and the Roasted Cauliflower ($17) was delicious as well. We shared the Garganelli ($26) pasta, something I'd highly recommend - the pasta and sharing - as the oil eventually gets to you. They make any pasta of your choice with butter and cheese for the kids, so our little one was happy to satisfy his pasta craving 'per his liking.\n\nNoise levels were on the lower end.

We were seated right away and ordered a bottle of wine, but unfortunately, it took over 30 minutes before we were able to place our food order. Our assigned waiter was nowhere to be found, so we had to flag down another waitress—who didn’t seem too pleased to help us.\n\nThat said, the food was absolutely incredible. We had the three-course meal along with a pasta dish, and everything was delicious. The wine was great, and we still had a good time overall.\n\nService, however, was very slow and inattentive—no one checked in to see if we needed anything throughout the meal. I’ll definitely return to try more dishes, but I hope the service experience improves by then."

            "text": "One of the BEST italian restaraunts Ive been to. First off, the atmosphere is beautiful. It was very crowded but dimly lit and the servers were very friendly and knowledgeable. The tables were quite small though\nWe started with some truffle fries and bread. The fries had a delicious thin texture and melted in your mouth. Very delectable. The bread was very soft, premium, and the dipping sauce went so well. The salad was great, the pork chop was extremely tender, not chewy like most are, and flavourful. It melted in your mouth and had the same consistency as wagyu beef!! The sauce was rich and paired well and the pork chop had good amounts of fat and crispy seared edges to compliment the meat. Highly recommend that dish as well as the beef and pork tagliatelle with burratta cheese. Expected the $6 cheese to be bigger but the quality and softness was well worth it. The pasta dish was a good portion and the flavours were well spread out and robust. Not the average pasta dish. It was restaraunt quality absolutely and it was very noticeably rich and didnt just taste like bolognese. Though i expected the colour to be different. They gave us a candle since it was a birthday and got two desserts: the chocolate carmel budino and the olive oil cake. The okive oil came came with luscious rich creme fraiche which beautifully complimented the soft cake and the well made compote, and the budino was absolutely delicious, chocolaty, and creamy with a hazelnut flavour and very subtle not overpowering caramel note. Very fancy italian meal that lasted two hours and a perfect birthday dinner for my mum.\n\nJust wish the tables were bigger and more burrata cheese. Also extremely loud surroundings and tables very close together"

Warm, charming, and effortlessly attentive, he brought the menu to life with his passionate recommendations and flawless wine pairings. He struck the perfect balance between friendly and professional, making us laugh while never missing a beat.\n\nGreat food is one thing — but service like Raphael’s turns a meal into a memory. We’ll be back for the pasta… but especially for him."

I wasn’t blown away, nothing necessarily unique about it, but I was very happy with it both with flavor and amount of sauce. Got a few other dishes and everything was delicious. The interior is well designed in a bright and trendy sort of way. Service was good, no problems there. The group I was with stayed a bit late, possibly past closing, but nobody came to tell us or shush us out, so I guess that was nice (although we felt a little bad about it)."

Both my sister and I took advantage of the $45 restaurant week menu. I had incredibly tasty meatballs for my first course, the Branzino for my second course, and vanilla cannoli for dessert. My sister had the Little Gem Caesar salad to start, the Gramigna pasta for her entree, and the nutella cannoli for dessert. We both enjoyed every bite of each dish, but the meatballs were to die for!! Incredible!  Loved this place, and highly recommend it, if you're in the mood for great food, and service."

            "text": "On a hot Wednesday evening on the upper west side, we had a reservation at La Pecora Bianca on West 77th Street. The restaurant was pretty quiet when we arrived, and initially we were given a table for 2 with direct sunlight in our eyes. We promptly asked for another table and were seated at the far end of the restaurant and had to move the table toward the windows to avoid the sun in our eyes.\n\nOur waitress was friendly and kept coming over to ask what we wanted. We were given tap water per our request and then after about 20 minutes our order was taken. The Hugo Spritz we both had was tasty, although heavier on the Prosecco with a smaller taste of the St Germain. When we mentioned this to our waitress, the 2nd round of cocktails was to our liking.\n\nOur food came out pretty quickly. The tagliatelle with bolognese was very good and so were the lemon ricotta, but after we were served the main course, the waitress was nowhere to be seen and we had to flag down another waiter to ask for some pecorino-romano cheese. When she finally did arrive it was to take our plates - so between bringing us our food and us finishing our food, she was not around. I didn't really like that, considering how eager she was at the beginning of our meal. I would have liked more water on this hot June day, but she did not come around to check on us.\n\nWe ended our meal with the chocolate hazlenut budino which was a fancy chocolate pudding (nothing special, and I don't recommend it). The meal was pretty rushed by the wait staff. I'd return if it was at a calmer pace.\n\nWhen we arrived, the restaurant was pretty empty; by the time we left (around 7pm) the restaurant was almost completely full. Reservations recommended.  We had one."

Had this restaurant marked to try for a long time so was excited to visit.  At 6:40 PM, I checked Resy and saw indoor seating available every 15 minutes until 8 PM. It seemed casual enough, so we didn’t book and just walked in.\nAt 7:06 PM, the hostess told us we’d have to wait until 7:45 PM for a table for two. This was confusing, as the dining room wasn’t full. Her tone was cold and dismissive. whether she was having a bad day or just didn’t want to help us, I’m not sure. but she offered no explanation, just a flat “no.”\nWe left feeling frustrated and double-checked Resy. The availability was still showing clearly open, so we booked a 7:15 PM reservation while standing outside. When we returned, the hostess was busy with someone else, and another staff member asked what was going on. We explained the situation—what we were told, what we saw online, and what we saw in person. He checked the iPad, mentioned that some guests were running over their time, and seated us within 30 seconds.\nSo… why couldn’t that have happened the first time?\nEven if the system was inaccurate or the tables were technically occupied, a bit of communication or courtesy would have gone a long way. Being that dismissive just made the experience unnecessarily unpleasant.\nThe food was fine, prices on the higher side, and the service once seated was okay.  Go to another location if you really want to try this spot as it is a famous chain in NYC."

The sunflower seeds further adulterated the dish, they could have easily been replaced by toasted hazelnuts. The shrimp were expertly cooked, juicy with a tender bite, and just the right amount of seasoning. The baratta, fresh and excellent as always. I was so lucky to find the corner table in the lofted area vacant at 4:45pm. The service was good, attentive, but giving me some privacy as they saw my notebook open with my pen in hand between services.
