Our group of four decided to share one of the family platters, and it was more than enough to satisfy everyone, with some leftovers to spare. The platter featured a whole chicken, ten chicken tenders, and three generous sides. We found ourselves needing to make an effort to finish it all!\n\nWe enjoyed three sauces with the chicken: soy garlic, hot honey, and Nashville hot, all of which were delicious. The side dishes also impressed us; we had mac & cheese, truffle parmesan fries, and buttery bread. I can’t wait to return!"

Il mio ragazzo invece con il Nashville è rimasto piuttosto soddisfatto. Cameriera passata 3 volte in 5 minuti a chiedere se andasse bene il panino, un po' troppo insistente."

I was very disappointed in the biscuit, it’s on the menu as a regular biscuit but it contains cheese, tons of sugar, and comes with honey butter not regular butter. Sugar overload. I wanted a salty biscuit especially after the sugary wings. Surprised they don’t mention the cheese on the biscuit on the menu. When I asked the waitress was annoyed because I didn’t mention I had allergies. I said, just because I don’t have allergies doesn’t mean I don’t have the right to know what goes on the standard biscuit that isn’t standard at all. It should be written on the menu that it’s made with cheese . The coleslaw was okay. I see why they lost their Michelin bib"

The service was friendly, quick and knowledgeable and the food....... oh goodness, the food.\nI wanted to try every single thing, literally. I would have been thrilled to have that ability.. what I did eat was absolutely incredible and the pictures are attached. The chicken bites had these amazing pops of spice and flavor, and the waffle chicken sandwich looked as good as it tasted; each bite was simply delicious. Next time, and believe me, there will be a next time, I'm simply going to use the menu as a food check list! 10/10 highly recommend!"

Mac and cheese is definitely just craft with the liquid cheese. Potato salad is 100% just grocery store potato salad. Chicken sandwiches were fine, chicken was dry but the sauce makes it seem like it’s not, but the texture is just not the best. Tables are pretty small for two people."

            "text": "Chick Chick delivers a mouthwatering fried chicken experience that goes beyond expectations, both in flavor and service. The Nashville fried chicken sandwich was a highlight, crispy, juicy, and perfectly spiced, nestled in a soft, buttery bun with creamy slaw that tied it all together. The chicken and waffles brought a delightful balance of sweet and savory, with golden, fluffy waffles and crunchy, well-seasoned chicken. The truffle fries were crisp and addictive, with just the right hint of truffle oil to elevate them without overpowering. The fried chicken and mac n cheese combo was pure comfort food bliss, featuring creamy, cheesy pasta paired with more of their signature crispy chicken. On top of the fantastic food, the service was incredible, friendly, fast, and genuinely attentive, making the whole dining experience feel warm and welcoming. Chick Chick is a must-visit for anyone who loves bold flavors, hearty portions, and top-notch hospitality."

            "text": "I saw a list of new Manhattan restaurants a little while back. I love supporting new businesses, and saw Chick Chick on the list. I know, I know…we already have tons of chicken themed restaurants. Chick Chick caught my attention though. They didn’t seem to be following the trends of other chicken restaurants, no. They were on their own wave, which I love. They offer what seems to be amazing Nashville chicken sandwiches, as well as what really caught my eye…the chicken and French toast dish. As I was skimming down the menu, this caused me to stop in my tracks, chile. It was enough for me to get on up to Chick Chick!\n\nI arrived, and really dug the decor. Just good feels, fun chickens on the walls, kinda giving an old school diner vibe, you know? Good music, good energy. I was seated and told the waitress I knew what I wanted, the French toast and chicken. She warned me that it’s more on the sweet side and asked if I were ok with that. I said, “girl, absolutely!” Lol I love me a sweet and savory combo, hear?! But I did appreciate the heads up. She also mentioned that I was gonna love it, which just furthered my excitement.\n\nOk, so this chicken and French toast dish is served with chicken tenders, apple chips, French toast and maple syrup. So she brings it out, and I was pleasantly pleased with the presentation. The first thing my eyes were drawn to, was the MASSIVE slice of French toast. I mean, she.was.THICK! It was a beautifully silky, creamy, custard-y brick-size French toast. It was nicely crispy on the outside though. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The chicken tenders were nicely done. Lightly seasoned, but seasoned enough. They were super juicy and crispy. I cut bite sizes of the French toast and chicken, got them on the fork together, and dipped them in what they called a maple bourbon syrup. It was definitely more like an icing. It was thick and rich, and delicious. It paired so well with the chicken and French toast. I did what I call, “icing skated” them around the plate to get every drop of the icing syrup. It was all disrespectful in the best way. I had to go and compliment the cooks after eating. They did an exceptional job!\n\nChick Chick is new and on the rise. If you want some good, fun fried chicken concepts, go check’em out!"

It never fails that the order is wrong every time we do takeout, which kind of kills the vibe and has me to the point of checking the order right there in front of the employees as they have sometimes argued with us if we check outside and come back in.

At no point the flavors feel regional. They are palatable to a large nationalities. The prices are very very fair. For about $16, you get very filling chicken sandwiches (sandwich, not a burger). Every flavor of burger is delicious. The sides are rocking. I had umami jalapeno chicken sandwich. It has beautifully fried chicken, fried onions, jalapeno coleslaw, and special sauce with a side of nice refreshing, crunchy pickle. The side was honey butter toast. If you don't want a meal or do not consume meat, come here simply for their sides and especially this toast. The toast is nothing like I have ever eaten. It is sweet with whipped cream, buttery-cheesy with just a right, subtle hint of garlic/umami. I paid $47 only for two of the above sandwiches and a side without tip."

I'd say the chicken strip, chicken wings, and Kim chee fried rice were a good choice. Kids (4,7,9) loved the wings and Mac&cheese.\n\nOnce we got back to our hotel(NJ), the wings were still good !!! BTW the wings aren't small\n, great size!!\n\nSo that's why I say if you show up and it's full, take it home! Servers were great and cooks were great. Bussers worked their buttons off!!!

We tried something new this time. I may have to come back and write a second review on behalf of our first two visits. The fried rice is so many flavors, the smokiness of the Chinese sausage with the pickled kimchi, the fattiness of the egg yolk is just everything you need, salt, acid, fat. How everything compliments each other is something everyone needs to experience. The chicken wings, I mean, you want sauce and crunch? They know what they are doing here. The Gochujang is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy that won’t kill you. And the customer service is always 10/10. Everything has been a 10/10."

            "text": "5 stars for the Nashville hot fried chicken sandwich, which is great fusion food: American-style chicken sandwich with the crispiness of Korean fried chicken and Nashville-inspired spices. (It’s not real Nashville-style hot chicken… we get excited every time, but for some reason no one does it right with the oil sauce—but that’s almost beside the point.)\n\nWe also got the chicken wings with soy black pepper sauce. The sauce was cool, but the chicken meat was tough and tasted like it had been overcooked or reheated or something. Maybe just a bad batch—they clearly know how to make fried chicken."

We got a mix of fried chicken, wings and tenders, all with different sauces. Paired with pickles, slaw and the Chick Chick fried rice, the meal was fantastic!"

The sweet potato fries were also wild, beyond flavorful and soft.\nNothing in this restaurant tasted oily or felt heavy, everything was absolutely delicious and flavorful.\nWe listened to k-pop (I feel like it was black pink’s greatest hits?) and the staff was very friendly. I appreciated the philosophy and vibe of the open kitchen.\nLiterally I want to bring everyone I know here."

We had the whole fried chicken, half Nashville hot half sesame soy, excellent excellent. The truffle fried rice was spectacular! The spot is cozy for the amount of ppl that go in but it was worth the brief wait. Great attention and service too!"

            "text": "My rating: Fire🔥\n\nAmbiance: Just above Average 🙃\nThis I like that this restaurant has a sitdown area but it seems like it doesn’t work. Inside are slightly small booths along the walk that dont fit much of anyone. The tables aren’t that wide so its hard to eat if your order multiple items. They do have an outdoor dining but if cold, not so ideal. I do love how you can see them making the food behind counter. Its very Hibachi style kind of.  I was looking like they getting down back there lol.\n\nService: Fun/ Attentive 👀\nMy server was really fun to have as he was making jokes and gave me the dos/donts of menu lol He kept coming to see if the hot chicken took me out yet but I was good! Service here is very good. I also like how u can pay in front or at table. Lost art lol\n\nFood: Tasty/ Hit the spot 😋\nThe Honey biscuit was my favorite because its so soft and well seasoned. It taste like homemade biscuits from Grandma lol. The Ramen had great taste, but I would have love more Ramen but it was goodness! Last but not least the chicken sandwich was bigger than my hand and held my own. Very crispy and a great kick to it. Not too spicy but ull break a sweat. Will be back for chicken strips that are sixe of ur body lol"
