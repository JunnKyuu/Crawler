I know it’s maintained a loyal customer base since opening, but I can’t express how nice it is to be able to still walk in and grab a spot at the bar most nights here. Most restaurants of this caliber that is not the case. This one just hits all the marks. My partner and I say it’s one of our favorite, if not our very favorite, restaurant in all of New York. The food, ambience, service all are of course 5 stars. Beyond those though there are many little intangible things about this place that really just push it into another realm. It’s truly special. It’s a true privilege to dine here and be treated by this staff. We will keep coming back."

The must gets are the lobster pasta and the burger — the Wagyu steak was great, but didn’t stand out versus other versions of it I’ve had. The desserts also stood out and were probably my favorite part of the meal.\n\nService was great at the bar. can’t speak to the dining room, but I’m sure excellent as well.\n\nValue for money was excellent, we spent about $180 post tax & tip for two people. Also, we’re were given a couple small complementary bites."

I agreed.\n\nOnce they figured out I was an influencer, a table magically opened up next to other tables that were empty.\n\nHorrible way to treat a customer. I hope the owner reads this and trains their staff to be better.\n\nEDIT IN RESPONSE TO OWNER: It is clear to me that your staff have a pattern of mistreating patrons at your establishment. If they did it to someone else, and did it to me... I'd say you have a big problem with how your staff conduct themselves. I wish your messaging to me would have been more regretful and reassure me that it wouldn't happen again. But it's your business, do what you want.\n\nMy review is an accurate depiction of my experience; future guests have been warned and can decide for themselves if they want to subject themselves to horrendous service from your staff."

This most recent experience was no exception with memorable standouts including the Madai  and Zebra Tomato starters, and Black Bass main. We always find a fantastic bottle of wine from their extensive wine list and their sommelier staff is highly knowledgeable.\n\nIt’s not just a meal here—it’s a culinary experience we look forward to every single time.

His staff was amazing, taking plenty of time to describe the ingredients and preparation that goes into each dish.  Not cheap, but worth every penny. You must go when in NYC."

And it was perfect for conversation for our early dinner. We had the 3 & 4 tasting menus; a bit of a serving challenge that staff handled effortlessly.  With the amuse buche, freshly baked breads, extra birthday dessert and petits fours, it was an exquisite dining experience.  Each dish was a revelation for the senses (waygu, scallops, langoustine, lobster, crab, zebra tomato, bass, vacherin, tart, etc.).  While we could not have been happier or more satiated with our dinner choices, we do want to return for the full essential tasting menu.  A special shout-out and thanks to essential’s maître d’hôtel, who graciously accommodated our every request, especially the round banquette table, and answered many questions - often with wonderful humor; and to our superb server, Juan David, who gave helpful guidance and menu descriptions in the most charming and mesmerizing delivery — that I could have listened to all evening.  The service @essential was beyond exceptional and is what made our evening particularly memorable.  We will return!"

The langoustine sauce is rich and unique, and the touch of citrus in the lobster makes it especially bright and flavorful. The wagyu beef is incredibly tender, paired with a side of mashed potatoes that are smooth and delicate. The vacherin has an intense aroma of cream, bergamot, and orange blossom. If there were a perfume with that scent, I’d buy it in a heartbeat! It tastes just as fresh as it smells. The soufflé, however, is a bit too sour for me. As for the cocktails, ‘Upstate’ feels perfectly wintry with its apple cider base, while ‘Always A Plum’ might be a good pick for martini lovers."

The creativity, paired with masterful finesse, elevated the dining experience to something extraordinary.\n\nIt wasn’t just a meal; it was an artful performance. A feast for the eyes, a symphony for the senses, and an indulgent journey for the palate. And the finale?

            "text": "Hidden away in the upper west side of Manhattan, Essential by Christophe is one of the best prix fixe menus I have ever tried, beating out other one- and two-star restaurants.\nThe atmosphere is bright, warm, and quiet. The restaurant is clean, with the bathrooms being especially clean. The temperature was slightly too high for a jacket, which was a distracting factor.\nWhen walking in, we were greeted warmly; the host did a good job of knowing our name, always adding to the meal. There is an intimate lounge and bar, serving a decent amount of drinks and snacks. Drinks and cocktails cost right around what you might expect; an example being the martini, placed at $24. The main dining room is directly next to the bar; the essential menu is the prix fixe, set at a reasonable price of $245.\nThe menu consists of 8-9 items; options are located at the second, sixth, and last course. Starting with a very well-balanced sweet potato and mushroom soup shot, fittingly called a Mushroom Cappuccino, sets the warm tone each dish has.\nThe scallop, sea bass, and wagyu were the most memorable after the first course.\nThe scallop sits in a thick sauce with a zucchini blossom; the zucchini blossom is what stood out to me. It had an extremely unique flavor and texture that I cannot fully describe.\nOur server mentioned that the sea bass was one of Chef Christophe Bellanca’s most staple menu items; I understand why. This dish demonstrates Bellanca’s talent to break norms and expectations. Many components of sweet, punchy flavors, including pomegranate, were hidden beneath the sea bass. I have never had fish with such a unique flavor; it is truly a beautiful dish.\nThe wagyu was not special; it was perfect nonetheless. It was cooked well with a nice, thick, somewhat barbeque sauce. This satisfied my craving for delicious meat.\nService was the just right amount of attention, not distracting from the dishes. Other than the balance of attention and timing, I do not feel anything was extraordinary about the service.\nOverall, Essential by Christophe is an amazing restaurant with some truly unique dishes at a fair price point."

You know, the kind where the service is either robotic or aggressively warm, the atmosphere so hushed you’re afraid to cough, and the whole thing feels more like a performance than a meal. But this place? It completely shattered those expectations.\n\nYes, it’s high-end, but it doesn’t smother you in formality. The design is modern and elegant, with warm beige tones that feel inviting rather than sterile. Noise levels are perfect—you can actually have a conversation without shouting, but it’s lively enough that you don’t feel like you’re dining in a church. And the best part? People aren’t sitting around in stiff suits looking miserable. You’ll see diners in polos, jeans, and nice shoes, which makes the experience feel effortlessly cool rather than pretentious.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the food—because wow. Every course was a knockout. The plates are small, sure, but you get options (3, 4, or 7 courses), and the quality-to-price ratio is way better than other so-called fine dining spots that don’t even come close to this level of execution.\n\nThey kick things off with bread, and not just any bread—perfectly baked, crusty sourdough that’s so good you don’t even need butter (but trust me, use theirs, it’s worth it). Then comes the amuse-bouche: a mushroom cappuccino with a sweet potato custard that just melts in your mouth. If it had been twice the size, I still would have wanted more.\n\nFirst course? I went with the tuna, and let me tell you, whoever is in charge of acidity here knows what they’re doing. Finding a raw dish with seasoning this spot-on is rare. Then came the langoustine—perfectly cooked, bathed in a sauce so good I genuinely considered licking the plate (I didn’t, but it was a close call). The lobster? Another win. The black pepper and coconut sauce actually delivers on the pepper part—a rarity in the world of “au poivre” anything.\n\nDessert sealed the deal. The chocolate tart is everything a chocolate dessert should be—rich but not cloying, with a deep bitterness that makes you want a second slice instead of regretting the first. And if you’re feeling adventurous, the L’Ardéchois (chestnut, rum, pear) is a knockout—it’s got a punch, but in the best way. They finish the night with a few petit fours because, of course, they do, and yes, they’re also great.\n\nService? Impeccable. The staff actually looked happy to be there (a small miracle in fine dining), and our server, Michael, was the perfect balance of warm, attentive, and never intrusive.\n\nThis place is a gem. A Michelin-starred spot that doesn’t feel like a museum exhibit. A high-end restaurant that actually makes you want to come back. And now that I’ve told you about it, I just hope I can still get a reservation."

Though, after walking in, I was warmly welcomed by the host, and then shortly by the manager. They kindly escorted me to a seat at the bar as if they were already expecting me.\n\nThe bartender, Jose, greeted me with both their dining room tasting menu and their bar menu. I hadn’t realize I went in a few minutes before their last call on food, so I quickly perused the menus. I inquired with Jose on several menu items and he provided me with such concise descriptions and details of the dishes in such a swift manner. I was quite impressed. He did not at all make me feel rush, despite the time constraint. Hats off to him.\n\nI don’t drink alcohol. However, their selection on non-alcoholic beverages, other than soft beverages, was abundant. Amongst their non-alcoholic wine, beer, & mock tails, I selected their Riesling. I’ve never experienced a non-alcoholic Riesling before, so it was nice to have that option for me, especially to pair with my food.\n\nPrior to enjoying my meal, I was sent an amuse bouche: their “mushroom cappuccino”. What a pleasant surprise! Presented in a clear espresso cup, was what seemed like a sweet potato puree, with a truffle foam filled to the brim. It was a great combination of flavors. It was even better that it came as a surprise as I was not expecting a gift from the chef to start my meal.\n\nAs an appetizer, I enjoyed the scallops. There were two luscious scallops, with caviar on each, with a buttery, yet light, champagne foam surrounding each scallop. There was so much flavor and texture within this dish. Truly, there is no description that would do this dish justice.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered “Leo’s Favorite Burger”. Every component of this burger consisted of ingredients well thought out and crafted; the romaine with a light vinaigrette; the shoe string fries with the house-made spicy ketchup; and the caramelized onions on top of the prime beef patty between the sesame buns. Chef Christophe impressively executes an elegant burger.\n\nI did not order dessert, however they sent me petit fours that were delectable and great palate cleansers. Another delightful surprise from the chef.\n\nOverall, my experience at Essential by Christophe exceeded my expectations. My only regret is that I did not experience more dishes on the menu. I’ve already booked my reservation for a full tasting menu in the next few weeks and am looking forward to another wondrous experience."

The head chef, who gained fame at Michelin-level French restaurants, has now ventured out on their own. They not only uphold the classic elements of French cuisine but also infuse it with their own creativity. In my opinion, it's more worthwhile to experience than several well-established French restaurants in New York.\n\nAdditionally, the service at the restaurant is attentive, catering to your individual preferences by adjusting dish combinations and flavors according to your liking. The staff is friendly yet respects diners' privacy, striking the perfect balance.\n\nFurthermore, the ambiance and location of the restaurant are excellent. Whether you're planning to attend a concert, opera, or take a stroll in Central Park after dinner, the restaurant is conveniently located near these attractions. The dining experience they offer complements these activities well, making any leisurely outing more memorable.\n\nOverall, it's a French restaurant worth experiencing for both tourists and locals alike."

Amazing wine matches. I will definitely be back - my new fave in NYC.\nChristophe was kind enough to come and say hello, the whole service team were amazing. Thank you for making our celebrations so memorable."

Such a warm, inviting, and elegant spot (and altho music was being played, the sound level was optimal for conversation). Since I was solo dining, I opted for bar seating and it was perfect. Food is fantastic. The chicken dish is amazing. I ordered a la carte but other diners around me ordered the set menu which looked great also. I will definitely be back."

            "text": "I want to leave some of the bad vibes in 2024 and look forward to this excellent restaurant having a great 2025.\n\nThe food was good. Chef Christophe clearly put a lot of thought into creating and preparing the Essential Menu, which blends classic French cuisine with flavors from around the world. In my opinion, the food deserves a Michelin one-star+ rating and isn’t too far from a solid two-star level. It wasn’t mind-blowing, but within its well-structured approach, I found touches like Mexican BBQ and Thai Tom Yum flavors, which was fun.\n\nWhat really let me down was the wine pairing. I ordered the most expensive option at $295 per person for the premium pairing, but it was far below my expectations. I was hoping for something creative from the sommelier, showcasing rare and unique wines, but the pairing felt like a series of “standard answers.” Out of the six wines, I’d already had four of them before.\n\nFirst, the promised premium cru Champagne was swapped out for a $20 bottle of generic Bourgogne Aligoté. I don’t understand how a wine like that makes it into a “premium pairing”—it was bland and simple. Then came wines like Hans Wirsching, Lynch-Bages Blanc, and Dönnhoff, all of which are extremely common and easy to find. The combined market price of all the wines served wouldn’t even reach $295. The only highlight was a 2015 Meursault, but even that wasn’t 1er cru. The biggest disappointment was the red wine paired with the meat: a weak, diluted Rhône Syrah that just didn’t work.\n\nWhat’s more, I noticed the restaurant served almost everyone who ordered the wine pairing the same lineup, except for the Meursault. I really don’t understand how a village-level Meursault, priced under $100 per bottle, justifies a $130 premium in the pairing. Overall, the wine list was boring and didn’t reflect any effort or taste from the sommelier. I’d honestly think other restaurants in New York at the same level nailed their wine pairings way better. Otherwise, I could pair my own wine by myself.\n\nOne last thing I found pretty annoying: the waitstaff listening on my conversations with my companion."

The mashed potato is very fine and creamy.\nThe gave us an extra mushroom cappuccino to start and a butter cake to take home. We loved both of them.\nYou should also try the wine pairing for sure.

Everybody makes you feel so welcomed and our waiter Michael made our experience super enjoyable. Be sure to request him! My partner and I had the 4 course pre fixe. We started off with the Rosalita cocktail, then we moved on to the yellow fin tuna and the sea urchin, both dishes were amazing. Then we had the scallops and artichoke, words can’t describe how phenomenal these dishes were !  We then had the black bass and the wagyu beef cap, our waiter recommended medium rare which was a great touch. We also paired those dishes with the Clear Sky cocktail which Michael recommended and let me tell you, he knows his flavors! We finally ended our night with the mango mango, fine feuilles and a cup of chamomile tea. I will 100% be back here, the chef came out and greeted us which made our night very special. Thank You for having us ❤️"

We feel the inspiration from Robuchon in multiple little things like the puree or the olive bread. The courses are generous without being overpowering and some of the assemblages are corky yet creating the perfect alchemy in tastes. Essential competes very well against some of the 2 or even 3 stars restaurants in NY and the seasonal menu will get us to come back  at least every season."

He was very impressed with the dishes and the wine pairings alike. He’s the son of a trained chef and loves trying new and interesting things and this did not disappoint in any way.\n\nI ordered the sea urchin, scallops, poularde, and the l’ardechois for dessert. I was looking forward to trying some new things and that I did. Everything was cooked to perfection and so delicious, and the wine pairings for our dishes were just amazing.\n\nAs a born and raised New Yorker, bringing my husband to spend his first Christmas here and it being almost our one year wedding anniversary is a special occasion to us; We mentioned this to Lucas and they brought us a small extra dessert and wrote “Happy Anniversary” on our individual dessert plates as well, just the perfect special touch.\n\nI would 1000% recommend Essential to anyone looking for a true fine dining experience, whether it’s your first, like ours, or you’re used to it."

            "text": "had a lovely birthday dinner here! we did the un, deux, trois, plus dessert menu, rather than the tasting menu, and it was a PERFECT amount of food. the menu itself is very seafood forward, and the technique on every plate is elevated while still being new/different than any other french restaurant. The waitstaff is top tier… definitely on par with michelin restaurant.\n\nThe first course we did the alaskan king crab tomato and the foie- both were excellent. I think the foie portion was the most generous I’ve ever gotten in the city. I was worried we might be too full after just that, but we made space for everything because it was so good.\n\nThe second course we did the scallop and the blue prawn, and honestly it’s hard to say which one was better. The scallop came with the most delicious sauce- and so was lightly cooked it was almost like eating a sashimi. It was tender and perfection. The blue prawn was more cooked and was topped again with a generous portion of kaluga caviar.\n\nFor our third course/entree, we did the ibérico pork and the lobster. Wow- the ibérico pork was stellar and truly a one of a kind dish… I have never had medium rare pork like that, but it was mind blowing. The lobster was also excellent, but not quite as good as the ibérico pork.\n\nAlso the pro for choosing your menu, you get more choices for your dessert course. We did cheeses and the souffle. The souffle was very good, but a little on the egg-y side for me. The cardamom ice cream that it comes with though… AMAZING. The cheeses were also very good, but after all the food- it was hard to finish. We took home the little madeleines and canneles and they were seriously stellar. The pastry chef knows what’s up."

I came for my 40th birthday, too bad I waited that long to find out what it is, not snails and frog legs lol, come try it out! We got the largest course you could get each and ordered different things and essentially tried everything on the menu!"
