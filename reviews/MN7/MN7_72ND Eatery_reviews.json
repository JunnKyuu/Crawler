The menu has something for everyone, fresh pizzas, burgers, rotisserie chicken, salads, sandwiches, and a full bakery and coffee corner. Prices are very affordable, a solid, satisfying meal runs around sixteen dollars plus tax, which makes it an easy choice for a casual lunch or dinner. Generous portions, great quality, and a cozy vibe make this a spot I’d definitely visit again."

It was an expresso shot watered down with lots of milk.  She insisted that only cappuccino has foamed milk, not lattes.  Told us to \"look it up on the internet\".   When I showed her Google AI info saying lattes had foamed milk, she showed me an internet image of cappuccino with foamed milk and said \"see!\" (as if that resolved the issue).  So... I then showed her an internet image of a latte with foamed milk which she refused to acknowledge!  Poor customer service to argue with your clientele, esp when you are  WRONG, lol."

Veggie burger was made with a rotten patty that had visible mold. They did not think once before serving us this spoiled food. Very disappointed…. When asked we were made another one but that was also bad, had no choice but to leave that place early to get out of the disgusting feel they created! That personal pizza should not be called pizza because there is no cheese on it. Chicken burger is another one with absolutely no flavor. This place gave me the worst food experience for me so far!!"

Polévka pro dva (velké porce) a kousek chleba 15 dolarů dohromady! Dávají polévky ochutnat! Skvělá nudlová polévka s kuřecími prsíčky, skvělá čočková polévka (bez masa) - vše domácí s láskou dělané. Dělají čerstvé sendviče s ingrediencemi na výběr, burgery (mexický, vaggie atp), grilované kuře, losos...Usměvavá obsluha. Prostě WOW. Můžeme jen doporučit!"

            "text": "Emerging from the space formerly occupied by Columbus Gourmet Foods is 72nd Eatery which opened a coupe of weeks ago.  This fast casual restaurant is owned by the same people.\n\nThe interior has been wonderfully renovated to a bright spacious space.  There are plenty of seating inside and out with great views of Columbus Avenue.\n\nStaff is so very friendly; I was greeted as soon as I walked through the doors.  Head chef, Chef Hollywood, was behind the counter the day I went for a visit and was busy chatting visitors up.  While not a lot of the food is out on display, the menu is somewhat extensive.  It boasts the usual American comfort food of burgers, sandwiches, soup, salad and heavily promotes their organic Rotisserie Chicken.  Initially, I was going to try their rotisserie chicken but saw that they had some nice salmon on display.\n\nI ordered their Baked Salmon with 2 sides ($15.95).  For the sides, I got Sweet Corn and Mashed Potatoes with gravy.  The sides were good but clearly the salmon was the star.  It was nice and flaky with a hint of citrus.  It was cooked a little bit more well done that I usually like but I think that is because it was under the heating lamp for a while.  A pretty good dish that is filling but light.  Glad I tried it.\n\nWill definitely be back to try their Rotisserie Chicken and other items on the menu.\n\nTip: 5% off online orders"

Really nice guy and appreciated my kind words I said about the food. If you're in the Upper West Side, definitely go here for a fulfilling meal. You will not be disappointed in the slightest and you'll get your money's worth. As someone who's not a regular to the UWS area, I'm already planning my next visit and I honestly can't wait!!\n\nPS - the desserts are really good. Tons of variety so if your sweet tooth has a craving, they got you covered there as well."
