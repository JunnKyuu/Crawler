Видно, что всё сделано с акцентом на качество и классику. Меню написано на больших досках мелом, это добавляет особого шарма.\nВнутри царит дух старой доброй гастрономии: высокие потолки, коробки и корзины, полки с выпечкой и ряды свежих бубликов и бейглов. Атмосфера очень живая-видно, что сюда приходят за настоящим продуктом и традициями.\nОсобенно приятно, что всё это не выглядит как «супермаркет», а именно как семейное заведение с историей. Это место явно создано для тех, кто ценит подлинный вкус и атмосферу.\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nИдеальное место для тех, кто хочет вкусно перекусить или взять домой что-то особенное."

They purchased sports, and entertainment content, including Parts Unknown.\n\nWe had hosted our friend in NY City when she was travelling and,  - Asians can be quite some foodies -- so we did lots of nice restaurants, and Zabar's and Fairway,  and we brought her to Barney Greengrass.\n\nThe lox and smoked sturgeon is to die for!  But Sturgeon and Sable are ...IYKYK.   The lox is damn good too.\n\nBack in Asia, Anthony Bourdain was filming, probably the segment in Penang, so when he was heading back, the TV station hosted a reception for him and his producers.\n\nOur friend met him  at the party and they were chatting. She said she had just come back from NY and really enjoyed the food. The bagels and lox were just great. He looked at her incredulously, probably imagining that she went to some tourist trap, had some pretty unexceptional food.  You know he could get pretty snarky.  Anyhow, he said, \"yeah, so tell me where did you go?\"\n\nShe said \"Barney Greengrass\". He was shocked  -- \"Barney Greengrass! ??No way. How did you know?  It's the best!\" Just amazing. The smoked fish is the best! It's a NY institution....\"\n\nHer street cred just went through the roof.\n\nAnd we helped. But Barney Greengrass did mostly."

Really good bites and no frills setting.\n\nGot the nova with an everything bagel appetizer as my main and it was honestly the best nova I’ve ever had. Bright, flavorful, but not too fishy. Plenty of cream cheese and extras to dress my bites with. TBH it was so good that it may have ruined all other nova for me.\n\nMy husband got the scrambled eggs and sturgeon and he loved it too. Perfect amount of saltiness. The everything bagels were also solid.\n\nDefinitely get the potato pancakes, they’re puffy and crispy with plenty of sour cream and applesauce.\n\nIt’s pricier than some other spots but for me, the quality of the fish was markedly better which made it worth it to me."

The potato puffers are good even having come from Germany. They are crisp on the outside golden and softy and doughy with the balanced acidity it needs.\n\nAs far as value for what it is it’s terrible and priced up there. 2 bagel combos, 1 potato puffer, 2x OJ you’re looking at 109$ without tip."

After our meal, the waiter brought the check without us asking, and only then told us it was cash only. There had been no prior notice—nothing on the menu or posted in the restaurant—and it was never mentioned when we ordered.\n\nSince we only had cards, one of us had to run out into the rain to find an ATM. When they came back (we hadn’t taken long), the waiter immediately returned to ask for payment. He had said earlier that there was no tax or tip, so we assumed the amount on the bill was final and paid the exact total in cash.\n\nBut then he commented that tip wasn’t included, which left us confused and a bit embarrassed. It turned out he meant tax wasn’t required, but tip still was—yet that wasn’t clearly communicated. If that had been explained properly, we absolutely would have left a tip. Instead, the whole situation felt unnecessarily awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nThere was clearly a misunderstanding, but it could have been avoided with clearer communication. A simple sign or note on the menu saying “Cash Only” would have helped a lot. It’s a small thing, but it changes the entire experience."

Potatoes tasted light and fluffy, outside perfectly crispy without being too hard or oily, and portion size was pretty big (and you know starches can fill you up quickly haha). They came with applesauce and sour cream which paired excellently.\n\nMy friend and I each ordered a bagel sandwich - I had the gravlox sandwich. The smoked fish was... fine? Maybe I should have tried the sturgeon (I think their speciality), but I have to say I'm not really sure why there's such a craze around their smoked fishes. It was all very yummy but I fear not uniquely so, and for $21 a bagel I honestly am just a bit perplexed by this.\n\nBit of a mixed bag here - I'd be keen to come back but honestly it would primarily be for the latkes haha. Also note that they are cash only, so come prepared!"

Luckily, I was planning on going to Peter Luger's this week, so I had some 💵.\n\nWe got seated inside near the bathroom and it was a bit cramped. But no problem since they were really busy.\n\nWe ordered the latkas and the combination sturgeon and salmon plate. The potato pancakes came out very fast.

You really needed the sour cream and apple sauce to make it interesting.\n\nThe sturgeon and salmon plate was tasty. We ordered sesame bagel 🥯 with the plate. Cream cheese, tomato 🍅, onion 🧅, a pickle 🥒, olives 🫒 and some lettuce came with the plate. Together, the sturgeon and salmon were pretty good.

The French toast was eggy and delicious. The whitefish salad was not my favorite. There are better places to get them if you're willing to travel a bit. The star was the hot pastrami sandwich. Soft, salty, spicy, just perfect. The service here is also great. Friendly wait staff and near constant refills of coffee! I kept hearing them recommend latkes. They're not on the menu but I hope to try it soon!"

They do an excellent Jewish breakfast, and I actually tried eggs with a variety of fish for the first time ever. The service was super friendly and attentive, and the place was so busy it was overflowing onto the sidewalk. Definitely make some time to stop here if you're on the upper west side and check out all of the cool pictures of Barney with various celebrities."

Smoked fish on a freshly baked bagel: absolutely stellar. A bit cramped inside but honestly impressive watching the staff at work—flowing seamlessly from table to table!"

Cash or card\n\nIt's fast, no frills.\n\nSturgeon scramble was delicious and served piping hot. Nicely toasted bagel that itself was great. Served with cream cheese.\n\nThe price for breakfast will probably set you back 30 dollars including tax and tip. Cheaper options are available if you want to grab and go"

We got latkes, herring sandwich and pastrami sandwich. There was a line before we got seated, the line goes faster if you are ok with seating outside."

The pastrami smoked salmon was also delicious, but it's the pickle that came with my sandwich that I'm still thinking about two weeks later. Will I ever have a pickle as good? Should I have emptied my suitcase of belongings and filled it with pickles, instead? I'll be back someday. Wait for me, pickles."

However, Barney Greengrass is not bombarded with tourists like Russ & Daughters or Katz's Delicatessen in the LES. You'll find local regulars sitting outside munching down on potato latkes, scrambled eggs & toasted bagels. Their specialty is smoked fish. Nova lox & cream cheese on an everything bagel is delicious but BG is the sturgeon king for a reason. The sturgeon is delicious! Service is friendly, fast & attentive, but on this visit, the server forgot the tomato slices & potato salad with my Sturgeon & Nova Lox Platter order 😾. Prices aren't cheap but reasonable for the generous portions. I like how BG is famous but still has a down to Earth, local New Yorker vibe. These kinds of old school New York establishments are a dying breed. So glad they survived the Covid lockdowns. Highly recommended. Support your local restaurants & small businesses 👍"

Mais le prix des plats est exorbitant car cela ne reste que des sandwichs ou des bagels. Il faut compter par personne de 35-40$ juste pour une assiette et une boisson. Ce lieu reste néanmoins une adresse à visiter."
