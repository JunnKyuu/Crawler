Served on ciabatta with arugula and jam, it hit every taste bud—the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The fries on the side were crispy and delicious. We also had the spinach and cheese omelette—super fluffy eggs, light and right.\n\nAlways a reliable go-to for a satisfying brunch."

Outside dining on a very pleasant summer night was also great. Highly recommend this place."

I arrived fifteen minutes early, and I was greeted at the hostess stand where I was given the option to have a drink or the go directly to the table. I had an iced tea at the bar, which was very satisfying and refreshing. We were led to the back room which was extremely dark, so dark that it felt like evening time. This was my least favorite experience of the meal along with finding food tucked into the booth seating under me. The Cesar Salad with grilled chicken was excellent with real anchovy in the dressing and crispy and tasty homemade croutons and Parmesan crisps which were a nice surprise. The chicken was freshly grilled and delicately seasoned. I asked for a surprise cake for my friend and we were delighted by the Raspberry Bread Pudding which had just the right texture - the slightly dense cake matched the perfectly creamy sauce. Overall, the food was very good, as well as the service, but I might request to sit in the front room next time, where there is light, and hopefully not booths packed with old food. The general manager, Sydney, was very nice to write a follow-up email."

We went back again to give it one more try because the breakfasts are so good! Donato, the new manager, was so friendly and you could tell has a good relationship with his staff. The experience was night and day. Our server, Veronica, was attentive and friendly. Truly 5 stars.  Our special requests were taken care of no problem, The food arrived quickly and was presented well. As per reputation, the popover was delicious and eggs benedict on point with a soft unique bread. Omelette delicious as well and accompanying greens were fresh and perfectly dressed. The only reason for 4 not 5 stars on the food is because the muffins were on the dry side and re atmosphere the whole place just feels a bit 'tired'. But with Donato now at the helm I highly recommend this restaurant."

I love that the eggs come with a small salad on the plate with delicious homemade dressing. The lemon ricotta pancakes are a must. You can mos definitely share them. I also had chicken sausage and the bacon was a hit. Another time we came for lunch and the burgers were delicious. As well as the chicken pot pie but you can't get it before 4 pm.\nI visit 3 Sarabeths in the city and I enjoy eating at every one of them."

I'd suggest adding a side of the ham because the saltiness of that and the sweet of the maple syrup is something special. The perfect amount of food before gallivanting around the city."

I especially enjoyed the lemon and herb braised chicken with fingerling potatotes from the Restaurant Week special menu.  I hope that becomes a regular dish- so tender and the sauce was amazing! A new favorite place 😀"

From the front entrance, entire staff were extremely friendly and courteous. We dined really early, so it was quite in the restaurant which was perfect for us. Food was great and drinks were strong and delicious. Everything was great but Chicken Pot Pie was our favorite. It was savory, creamy and rich. Chocolate toffee cake was extremely rich and delicious as well. Overall, a really pleasant evening thanks to wonderful staff and great food!"

            "text": "The restaurant week $30 two-course lunch was quite good. The watermelon and pumpkin seeds added textural contrast to the gazpacho, while the avocado gave it some richness. The doubled dipped crispy chicken was served on a bed of cabbage salad. The amount of dressing was just right but it could have done away with the cornbread croutons as there were not crisp or but rather dry and crumbly. Price-wise this offer is almost getting the first course for free as most plates are around the $30."

Everything is showing it's age at this point, and it's time for a refresh...\nService was Good - but not Excellent, Good was Good - but not Excellent and Atmosphere is a little less than good with chairs that are loose, dirt in the corners and the crevices.\nIt's time to close down for a week, clean up, shape up and start fresh.  You guys are Better than this"

            "text": "One of the best breakfast places over tried so far. The food is amazing and there’s no way to describe how good it is. Everything we got tasted perfect and very well made.\n\nThe only bad thing is: everything is very expensive in Manhattan, I get it. The food was totally worth the price so it was not a problem. But when it comes to the orange juice that’s where I see there’s something wrong. $12 a glass of orange juice that is not even fresh and squeezed at the moment. I’m very picky when it comes to that and I definitely know when an orange juice is fresh squeezed, but paying $12 for a glass where you can see they pouring it in a cup from a gallon is very disappointing. Many places (most of them) serve artificial orange juice. I get it. But they have a different price for that. All my experience in going out for brunch or breakfast where I ordered orange juice, I never paid that much for an artificial one.\n\nSo this is the only crazy thing I saw and I experienced. I would definitely go back but not ordering the orange juice again.\n\nOverall, everything was perfect and tasty."

La comida no me gustó en lo absoluto los huevos benedictos estaban muy crudos y el avocado toast muy salado, la panquecas  llegaron frías. No volvería a ir a este sitio no lo recomiendo."

My husband and I opted for a brunch outing, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The buttermilk pancakes and crispy chicken sandwich we selected were a delight. Accompanied by their timeless mimosa and a passionista, our meal was thoroughly enjoyable. If you find yourself uncertain about where to indulge in brunch, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this establishment a try"
