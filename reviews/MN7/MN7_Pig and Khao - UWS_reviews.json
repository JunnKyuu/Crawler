From the moment we were seated, our server, Matthew, truly elevated the entire experience. His attentiveness, friendliness, and genuine enthusiasm made us feel welcomed and well taken care of throughout our visit.\nWe decided to try a variety of dishes, and each one exceeded our expectations — everything was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The food alone would have been enough to bring us back, but the outstanding service made the evening even more memorable.\nWe’re already looking forward to returning soon to explore more of the menu and relive such an exceptional dining experience.\n& Tacos!"

Had the papaya slaw dish after we ordered our main meals bc we saw so many of that dish passing by. So good! Tacos: perfect. And the curry chicken noodles dish (can’t remember the name, but know the ingredients) was beyond delicious. Plus, Lucky Buddha beer to wash it down. Just an incredible experience. Will return as soon as we’re hungry again! Kudos to this place!"

Every dish we tried was superb — from the pork belly adobo that melted in your mouth, to the tocino wings that hit the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The sizzling sisig came out bubbling and packed with flavor, and the crab fried rice tied it all together beautifully.\n\nThe cocktails were just as impressive — creative, tasty, and full of character. You can tell there’s real thought put into every mix. Between the bold flavors, vibrant atmosphere, and attentive service, Pig & Khao is easily one of the best dining spots in the city. Can’t wait to go back and explore more of the menu!\n\nFrom the BX to the Upper Westside; this trip was 100% worth it!"

I came in without a reservation and had no problem getting a seat at the bar (on Wednesday around 6:30 PM).\n\nOrdered the sinigang fried shrimp, which came with crispy fried okra — super flavorful and delicious, with a nice tang and a kick of heat.\n\nWe also shared the pancit. It was different from the traditional version — mostly noodles, and I really wished there were more vegetables (at least more bean sprouts maybe). It felt a bit one-note in flavor, though the shrimp in it had a great grilled taste that stood out.\n\nThe bartender was kind, attentive, and genuinely funny — made the solo bar experience feel warm and welcoming.\n\nOverall, a fun, casual spot with character and some standout dishes."

            "text": "As a Filipino, my family and I were so excited to try Pig and Khao. However, it disappointed us greatly. We understand it’s Filipino fusion, but all the flavors simply felt lost in every dish. It didn’t resonate to us as Filipino fusion at all; felt like it was adapted TOO MUCH to suit Western palettes. The tocino wings tasted nothing of tocino. The adobo needed more soy sauce, though the crispy pork belly was good. The kalabasa sa gata was nothing ordinary, and such a small portion!!!! Khao Soi was alright- wish the broth was creamier. The sisig was the worst one, with the seasoning as mostly soy sauce- very one-dimensional dish. I will say that the best dish they offer would be the coconut rice. It was perfectly cooked, and perfectly coconutty! But that’s about it. Glad to see good reviews from this place and that other like it, but again, mostly because it’s been adapted to Western palettes."

The service is usually acceptable, but I went with a group of five today for my daughter's birthday - and the service was atrocious. Although we ordered together, three individuals received their food, ate, and had their plates cleared while the other two had yet to even receive an appetizer. The waitress never checked in during that time - and we were required to flag someone down to ask about our meal. No apologizes were given. While the main dishes came out in another 10 minutes (i.e. they still needed to be prepared), the appetizer was still not delivered. When we said we no longer wanted it, we were told that it was already being prepared. Again, no apology was given for the inconvenience. Although the reservation was booked for my daughter's birthday, no mention was made of that - even when we told our waitress. When we went to pay, only half the table received a bill - while the other half was left to flag someone down to pay their tab. Again, no apologizes were given. I was very disappointed by the lack of concern for service despite multiple missteps, which makes me reconsider taking guests there."
