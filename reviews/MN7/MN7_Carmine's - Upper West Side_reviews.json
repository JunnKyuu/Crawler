Na segunda vez pedi o ravioli de queijo com molho pomodoro. Um absurdo de bom.\n\nEu particularmente sou fã de um bom chopp gelado. E fui isso que bebi. Pedi o chopp peroni e estava na temperatura ideal e também vem bem servido.\n\nComo não estávamos no pique de esperar a fila e não tínhamos reserva, optamos por sentar no bar e comer e beber ali mesmo.

The atmosphere reminds me of a New York City apartment in the 30s or 40s of an Italian immigrant family, the aesthetic goes perfectly with the family style food service.  The family style service goes down perfectly when you come as a group.  This time, I came with 2 other people.  We order their Caesar Salad, Garlic Bread (half with parmigiana cheese), and Chicken Parmigiana with Penne.  I have to give it up to Carmine’s they have one of the best Caesar Salad I have ever tasted.  The garlic bread is always fresh and this was the first time I tried it with cheese, which was a nice touch.   Next up was the Chicken Parm with Penne which was so tasty and flavorful.  Lastly we grabbed homemade cannolis for dessert, with coffee. Which was a great way to cap off an amazing meal and like always when I come here we all left with doggy bags because we were not able to finish all the food they served us."

Service was actually one of the best I have experienced in New York also with a cheerful and family vibe in the restaurant. The portions are still very very large. A party of three had a hard time finishing 70% of two dishes, so please consider if you are visiting with a smaller party. Caesar's salad with anchovies is great and flavorful while Rigatoni Country Style was a new menu to me but still delicious. Also had their Colada and Cosmo (frozen) cocktails and they were also good."

The wait staff and manager were amazing constantly checking on our table.\n\nThe manager even cleaned off plates from the tables which is amazing because normally managers stay in the back and it was great to see the interaction with everybody in the restaurand that she supported her staff by actually helping clear off tables and talking to the guests.\n\nI give this restaurant 10 stars, and I highly recommend it. We will definitely be back.\n\nOur waiter was awesome and took the time to explain how large the dishes are so that we did not overorder are food?There were 6 of us.We ordered three meals and we still had tons of food left over."

            "text": "My wife and I had previously eaten at the Times Square location a few years ago and enjoyed it. We recently got back from a trip to NYC and ate at the Upper West Side location with our son and his fiance, wanting to share the experience with them. Here's how it went.\n\nPROS:  The food was really good and there was plenty to eat between the four of us. We also like the atmosphere and the complimentary bread is fantastic. The price was reasonable considering the amount of food you receive.\n\nCONS:  Service, service, service. Our server, Alex, was initially attentive and all was going well early on. However, once we got our food we never saw Alex again. Well, we did see him, but he never returned to our table. Our water pitcher ran dry about halfway through our meal and was never refilled.\n\nThe longer this went on the more irritated I became. I tried to get Alex's attention three times, waiving my arm in the air and actually yelling his name. He looked at me directly and either ignored me or just looked through me. Either way, he never acknowledged and never returned. 40 minutes after we had finished our meal I was trying to just get our ticket, but again Alex would not acknowledge me. FINALLY, he came up behind us and placed the check on the table.\n\nWhat is disappointing is I actually reached out to the management via their website the day after our return. Over a week later and I still have not gotten a response. I do not enjoy leaving negative reviews as I would rather not say anything. There is so much competition in the service industry that customer service can really separate one restaurant from the other based on how they treat their customers. I'm just disappointed that our concerns were never acknowledged, as if they don't care."

Huge portions for 3 people. Shared chicken Parmesan, lasagna and garlic bread with mozzarella. Will be back next time I’m in NY! Just wish they had craft beer!"

            "text": "Carmines Upper West Side 91st Street on Broadway is a great place for larger groups to enjoy Italian cuisine.  The menu has all of the basic Italian food dishes. The selections are served family style. I think this adds to the conversation and family friendly atmosphere. The food is remarkably well prepared. I thought the spaghetti carbonara was excellent. It can be a difficult dish to get right. Some restaurants will take shortcuts that will impact the flavor of this gourmet dish. The rigatoni bolonase was ok. The Carmines salad and the cold antipasto were both wonderful dishes. My guests commented that they should not have filled up on the bread! The bread is very moist and tasty. However, the salads and the main dishes are pleantyful. I will repeat the advice from my guests. Do not fill up on the bread! Carmines is not a first choice for quiet dinnertime conversation! The place is full of chatter from the other tables. You will hear people singing happy birthday mixed with general crowd noise. Yes it can be noisy at times, but it is a happy noise that doesn't seem to get in the way of nearby conversation.  All in all, the food was delicious and the experience for my first time guests was a pleasant one. They were very happy with the food and the dining experience."

We were told that the meals would be family-sized and to expect huge portions. Although we were skeptical, when the food came out we were more than happy to rest our eyes on our big plates of food.\n\nThe staff were so all so welcoming and nice. Our server Jake was so nice, respectable, and attentive. The food was amazing. Would def come back again!"

            "text": "SAVE YOUR MONEY – Carmines Is Not What It Used to Be\n\nI would give them one star, but out of courtesy for the waiters attempt to fix our frustrating dinner, I’m giving them two.\n\nMy boyfriend and I stopped in for a quick dinner—just a simple penne alla vodka. He was visiting from out of state and had never had genuine Italian food before. Unfortunately, Carmines was a big mistake.\n\nWe asked for grilled chicken over the pasta, and the kitchen served us dry, overcooked, bland chicken—twice. After the first time, I spoke to the manager, who said they would cook the chicken on the side to avoid it overcooking from the heat of the pasta.\n\nBut when the waiter came over, things got more confusing. He told me that “only old people eat al dente,” and claimed the kitchen was changing the entire recipe, which left me confused and unsure of what I was even getting. The manager later confirmed that they had in fact changed the recipe—although all we ordered was penne alla vodka with grilled chicken on the side the second time around.\n\nIn the end, we received two dishes with bone-dry chicken. We were frustrated, tired, and just wanted the night to end. The manager did try to offer a dessert to make up for the experience—even though we politely declined—but the gesture felt too late after an hour and a half of confusion.\n\nThe waiter and a single espresso martini were the only things that saved the night.\n\nAnd yes, we still paid $30—plus the cost of our mental stability.\nWhat was supposed to be a casual, peaceful dinner became confusing, demeaning, and exhausting."

Highly recommend for a fantastic Italian meal!"
