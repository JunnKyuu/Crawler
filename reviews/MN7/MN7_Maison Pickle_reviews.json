Their French Dip is the gold standard and Maison Pickle just doesn't cut the mustard... There was however mustard on the plate which was never mentioned. I should have know it wasn't going to be good when I asked if the meat could be sliced extra thin, I was told it is already sliced... So it's sliced and sitting around for who know how long... The 24 layer cake tasted stale. I so wanted to love my meal."

The roux on my deluxe French dip was floury and gross. The sandwich would be SO much better if it had caramelized onions and cheese inside, instead of a haphazard topping of roux and batter-fried onions (like, how am I supposed to dip it if half the ingredients are outside the sandwich??).\n\nThere's also kind of a weird smell in the restaurant that turned my stomach, I am sensitive to these things but it smells a bit like a dirty rag and burnt grease :("

The real issue is what the restaurant does to ameliorate the situation. We had just this happen tonight at Mason Pickle. Instead of simply seating us and ignoring the wait, Bar Director, Jorge Paz, and his staff, including the Manager of Mason Pickle,treated us like royalty. Their apology was in the form of lovely appetizers and fabulous desserts. And then there was our meal itself. Every morsel visibly inviting and fabulously delicious. Our party of eight nearly licked their plates clean. Put Maison Pickle on your go to list; you will not be disappointed. To the folks at Maison Pickle… thank you, thank you, thank you, for a lovely evening.  We’ll be back!"

Service was tops though and I enjoyed my Smoke& F ire cocktail  but ugh, that French Dip, not sure how that sneaked past the kitchen staff. I made the bigger mistake of ordering the deluxe. Way too much going on there. Cannot taste anything except this cheese sauce which I wish I could say was better. The beef has no seasoning whatsoever. At least not that I can discern. Bread is way too soft. Basically just blah - one texture, no real taste. Deviled eggs were decent, have certainly had much better and the pull\napart bread is gimmicky - with too much butter to be practical. Just shock value. Really pains me to leave such a harsh review but at these prices and with so many options, I have little choice."

They had a great music playlist going Sunday night and we sang about every song. 3 of us had the steak frites and another had a French dip. All delicious and the garlic pull apart bread was a great starter! Finished our meal off with the 24 layer chocolate cake!

When we came in, they insisted that we could only sit on the side by side mezzanine seating upstairs due to a performer coming in at 12. They stated that all of the tables in the main area were taken up due to this. We reluctantly agreed and took those seats. However, during the entire duration of our stay, there were at least 8-10 unoccupied tables in the main area. We left around 12:40 and the performer never came on. In addition, the tables in the upper area became available. When we asked the hostess if we could move she rudely said “no, there’s a large party I have to seat. You’re going to have to stay where you are.” It was extremely infantilizing. In addition, there were two seats remaining  that she seated a different couple at about 15 minutes later.\n\nOur server was quite nice. However, we asked for our steak with fries and she said she would check with the chef. That did not happen, it came with breakfast potatoes instead. The steaks was medium rare instead of medium well as asked. The challah French toast was incredibly dry and cold. We did not get any condiments including salt, pepper, ketchup or syrup. We had to ask for these.\n\nClearly we were very frustrated and asked for the manager. The manager Tiffany arrived after 10 minutes and all she could offer was to “re-educate her staff.”\n\nOverall, terrible experience. Will never come back."

Carlee was just pleasuable and attentive to us and the rest of her tables in her section. The Artichoke appetizer was DELICIOUS as well as the PULL apart Bread (Garlic and Parm topping)!

After greeting us and pouring some water she was never to be seen again. It wasn’t until 20 minutes later we had to finally flag down a server who was on his way out for the night to take our full drink&food order because we couldn’t get Carly’s attention. Once our food arrived we were extremely unimpressed… everything other than the pull apart bread tasted average & honestly comparable to the Cheesecake Factory. We were hoping to end the night on a high with their famous layered chocolate cake, but once the busser cleared our food, Carly dropped the check and walked away…. No additional drink order, didn’t ask if we wanted dessert, nothing. It then took us another 10 minutes to flag her down and tell her we wanted the cake & by then she said “the kitchen said we could only take it to go” as by this time they were closing up. Honestly the most laughable experience with non impressive food. Don’t waste your limited time in NYC by coming here.\n\nPS we got the cake to-go, and it also sucked. My group all took one bite and then threw it away."

Their mac and cheese was also very cheesy but left much to be desired. The steak was over cooked, and the cake was dry/stale. The drinks were great and very strong. As for atmosphere, the biggest problem is the tables are much too close to each other and the spaces can be cramped. The moody lighting and decor was great otherwise. Our server was also prompt and kind."

My dining companion ordered steak cooked medium-well, well, it was way dry and burnt. Thankfully, the waitstaff agreed that it was overcooked and got another - though we question their quality control. The place is much bigger than it looks from the street..."

            "text": "I came to Maison Pickle for their $45 Restaurant Week dinner and had such a great experience. Everything I ordered was delicious and satisfying from start to finish. The watermelon salad was super refreshing, loved the mix of red and yellow watermelon with cherry tomatoes, feta, and a tangy lime vinaigrette. The crab artichoke and spinach dip was so creamy and flavorful, and the toasted bread it came with was the perfect pairing.\n\nFor the entrées, I had both the steak frites and the chicken & eggplant parm. The ribeye steak was cooked just right and full of flavor, and the fries were super crispy. The parm was rich, cheesy, and comforting, definitely something I’d order again.\n\nDesserts were such a highlight too. The Oreo icebox pie was nostalgic and creamy, and the 24-layer chocolate cake was just iconic, decadent but not overly sweet. Overall, the food was amazing, the portions were generous, and the service and ambiance made the experience even better. I’m already looking forward to coming back!"

            "text": "We were expecting so much.  Thought maybe with a French word in the name portions might be more euro and less Texas.  Steak ordered mid-rare came out uneven but mostly medium well.  We did not even order bread which is like an enormous loaf with some very large topping. Seemed like butter.  So enormous super size me portions.  I got suckered in by the name patty melt.  And the server highly recommended it.  Except that it wasn't a patty melt and the description on the menu was not a description of what you get.  E.g. two patties.  And my bad it does say buttermilk bread.  I object to other than rye bread.  There is a Reuben on the menu so maybe they could make the patty melt to order... grilled rye caramelized onions patty with melted Swiss cheese.  This is just a great classic I was disappointed in the monsterous size and mediocre interpretation.  This is a place to go if you like making 3 meals out of one. And my daughter did have a small fly on her plate... So we actually did not take her leftovers home"

On the other hand, the service felt like “just tell me what you want.” We received our drinks about 10 minutes after ordering, and my steak was only slightly warm. I expected it to come straight off the grill."

The Gruyère fondue fries, mac & cheese, and garlic pull-apart bread were all amazing (and huge portions!). Ordered bloody mary & El Segundo wallet for drinks. But the 24-layer chocolate cake? Absolutely unreal. Best chocolate cake ever."

The chicken and French toast were absolutely delicious, with the perfect balance of crispy and sweet, however it was a large plate and messy to eat. The mac and cheese was rich, cheesy, and full of flavor. The pull apart bread was fresh and sooo good! My friends also enjoyed their meals but agreed to large to finish. Portions are massive, so come hungry or be ready to take leftovers home. The service was attentive, with staff making sure we had everything we needed. The restaurant stays busy, so I highly recommend booking a reservation in advance."

The vibe is great, the service is great but the Deluxe French Dip is next level.\n\nThey will also recommend the pull apart bread and there is a reason. It. Is. Scrumptious. Cocktails are also delightful. I have yet to try the chocolate cake but one day, it will be mine.\n\nCan't recommend enough!"

            "text": "On a quick girls’ trip from Miami to New York, we had one mission before catching a Broadway show: find a solid brunch spot that wouldn’t feel like yet another tourist trap. A local swore by Maison Pickle on the Upper West Side, so I trusted the tip, hopped on Resy, and locked in a table.\n\nWe rolled in straight from the airport (shoutout to NYC’s public transit for the unintentional city tour), and even though we were running on travel fumes, we were seated right away. The staff was friendly, fast, and ready for our big brunch expectations.\n\nWe weren’t super hungry, so we kept it light: a couple of drinks and one dish to share. I ordered The Razzle, a gin-based cocktail with raspberry and lemon. It sounded fun, but it was a little too tart for my taste—one of those drinks that starts cute but overstays its welcome.\n\nThen came the real star: the Croque Madame with fried chicken. When we ordered it, we thought we’d get a fried chicken side situation. Nope. The fried chicken was in the sandwich. Surprise! And what a happy accident that was.\n\nCrispy chicken? Check. Toasted bread? Check. Perfectly runny egg on top? You bet. Every bite was savory, crunchy, and indulgent in the best way. We definitely weren’t prepared for how good it was, but we rallied like champs.\n\nAnd let me just say: everything coming out of that kitchen looked ridiculous—in the best way. French toast towers, massive sandwiches, comfort food galore. If we’d shown up with a real appetite we would’ve gone to town.\n\nFinal take: Maison Pickle is now firmly on my NYC rotation. Great service, bold flavors, and a far cry from the overpriced, underwhelming spots that somehow stay packed in Midtown. If you're looking for brunch that delivers without the tourist tax, this is your place."

Got the 24 layer cake and aside from being pretty it lacked flavor… overall I just didn’t care for this restaurant. Only thing I absolutely loved was the watermelon salad.

Whether it’s brunch with friends or a cozy dinner date, Maison Pickle always hits the mark. A real Upper West Side favorite."
