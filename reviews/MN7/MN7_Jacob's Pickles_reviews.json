The wedge salad was really yummy and I love that they added chicken so it could be my whole meal. The portions are huge so ounce for ounce it’s a great value. You will definitely have leftovers. The service was very friendly. They have too many high tables which many people don’t like to sit at. But the place is huge, so it shouldn’t be hard to get a low table. The music and acoustics are loud. Very few vegetarian items, but you won’t go hungry. We will definitely be back to try other things on their menu."

When the server brought a chair we noticed the chairs were very worn and used and when you sat on them they wobbled alot we had to ask for another chair and it was still the same.\n\nWhen it came to service the waiter took a while to get our orders. Now we had to wait a whole 43 min for our food to be served mind you we just had two chicken sandwiches. 2 tables that were seated after us recieved their food first. When asked the wait when the food is coming they said soon. Now when I asked for the check the waiter took 20 min to give us the check I had to ask the host to see whats going on.\n\nIn terms of food their old location was much much much better. The place looks all nice and fancy but the service and food was better than in the old location.\n\nDo with this what you will."

Same quality food/menu, perfect vibe/ambiance, solid service, and generous portions. It was a vibrant Halloween night and eponymous owner Jacob was in the house keeping an eye on things.\n\n11/2024: Highly recommend! We have been dining at Jacob’s Pickles since they opened in 2011, and they have been a reliably delicious and fun place to dine (brunch, lunch and dinner!). Doesn’t seem like you can go wrong with anything off their menu but we can personally vouch for the Chicken & Pancakes, Honey Chicken & Pickles, Mushroom Gravy Smothered Chicken, and Hot Chicken Biscuit! Their large house salad is also a great side (delicious dressing!). Generous portions will ensure you’re satisfied and/or have some tasty leftovers to bring home."

We visited their newest location at 680 Columbus Avenue, on the Upper West Side, we had previously went for Brunch at the location on Amsterdam Avenue. My wife and I shared the “Western Cheese Omelette” and it did not disappoint, plenty of everything in it. Coffee is good and comes with free refills. The atmosphere was loud, if you like quiet, not the place for you even though once, you settle in, you belong. They also have a climate controlled outdoor terrace, great to suck up on the morning Sun. One of the highlights of our visit was the service. The place was packed however, our waitress and bus boy were always attentive and present. Definitely worth a visit, check it out.\n\n“Eat deliciously\""

I attended a private event after enjoying happy hour, which offered plentiful food and drink options. I highly recommend the Mini Manhattan flight: fun, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The regular and happy hour menu caters equally well to vegetarians and meat eaters, with every dish prepared to perfection. Despite handling a full bar, restaurant, and our event simultaneously, the staff remained attentive, organized, and gracious throughout.\n\nI won’t wait another five years to return.\n\nReview from 5 years ago:\nGreat vibe, food, drinks and service. Jacobs Pickles will not disappoint. They have unique and traditional dishes. A surprisingly great array of food for both meat lovers and vegetarians."

All four we got were good and the standouts were the horseradish cukes and the green beans. We also got the poutine (ok - definitely needed more gravy); classic mac and cheese (fine) and the honey chicken on a biscuit (chicken was delicious, biscuit was good and the grits on the side were unnecessary). In general, food was solid and deserved about 4 stars.\n\nWhat brought the rating to five was our server Mason. The perfect mix of friendly and attentive and leave diners alone to enjoy their meals.  One of the best servers I have met in a while.\n\nTables were pretty close so our neighbors almost felt like they were a part of my dinner party."

We tried their delicious Matzo Ball Soup this time, and deviled eggs. Both were fantastic.\n\nOur server James was excellent who ensured we had a pleasant experience during our time here.\n\nOlder review: After a walk-in waiting list fiasco (they got our number wrong) and waiting for over 40 mins, we got seated in a rather packed corner with fairly limited space to sit comfortably. We couldn't blame the table behind us either, because they definitely needed that extra space.\n\nJordan, our server, got us straight to ordering; A freshly squeezed lemonade, Biscuits Gravy & Eggs ($16), Classic Mac & Cheese ($18), Hot Chicken Biscuit ($22), and Okra & Chiles ($13).\n\nIt's your typical American comfort food; giant portions and good for a once in 6-months kindda meal - extremely tasty though! For the health conscious person, sharing an appetizer and entree would make perfect sense.\n\nFor the Hot Chicken Biscuit plate, it would've been nice if both pieces of chicken had the Nashville Hot Sauce on top. Only one piece had a generous pour, so the other one felt pretty bland!\n\nJordan was attentive all throughout, and service overall was quick. Food arrived within 15 mins of placing our order. Noise levels were on the higher end and was pretty difficult to have a conversation without raising your voice around 2 pm on a spring Saturday!\n\nWe might drop by for a drink or two the next time, and to order their Okra & Chiles again which was really pickled!"

It’s big, spacious, beautifully decorated, and has such a warm, lively vibe. The service was just amazing; our server, Arielle, did a fantastic job helping us with menu selections and pairing dishes perfectly.\n\nWe started with the Pick-4-Pickles...a must-try! The Candy Beets took me by surprise with how good they were. The Hot Sour Pickles were bold and flavorful, the Big Dill Culture Pickles were crisp and classic, and the Sweet & Spicy Carrots were absolutely delicious. All that flavor for such a great price!\n\nFor drinks, both the non-alcoholic and alcoholic options were great. The Jacob’s Pickles Biscuit Beer was incredible... it paired beautifully with the Honey Chicken & Biscuit meal that came with cheesy grits (which were to die for).\n\nWe also had the Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese: extra cheesy, creamy, and full of flavor. And as a self-proclaimed French fry lover, I have to say..... these fries were amazing! Perfectly crispy on the outside, soft inside, and seasoned just right.\n\nEverything that came out of the kitchen looked beautiful. Honestly, you almost don’t want to eat it because of how pretty the presentation is. But the smell and aroma of the food make it impossible to resist.\n\nThe ambiance is great... perfect for talking, relaxing, and enjoying THE GREAT food selections. Even the washrooms were spotless (which always says a lot about a restaurant).\n\nI’d definitely recommend making a reservation, because this place is already a hot spot on the Upper West Side.\n\nHighly recommend Jacob’s Pickles and I’ll definitely be coming back. It’s officially a new favorite."

            "text": "After walking by Jacob’s Pickles every time I went grocery shopping, I finally got the chance to go in this weekend. It was a food extravaganza!! Our server was Joha. She was so kind, provided amazing recommendations, and kept coming back to check on us! She was so friendly. The food was AMAZING. My friend and I split the pickle smaller… the pickled beets were interesting… almost like a candle. The bread and butter pickles were the perfect amount of sweet and tart. Huge fan of them!! I got the classic chicken biscuit, which was made to perfection. The chicken was glazed and almost a bit caramelized with honey, not too sweet but so perfect. It made amazing leftovers as well. I was so happy with this meal and will definitely be back, when I can afford it. THANK YOU JOHA AND THANK YOU JACOB’S PICKLES!"

Staff is friendly but damn they are running around because even on a Sunday night this place is BUSY.\n\nFood was very hit or miss. Pickles were great but the biscuits and grits would have been sent back if served at any real southern restaurant. We loved the fried chicken. All in all, I’d say Jacob’s Pickles has lost its special sauce but hoards of other diners coming in, even during non brunch hours, would tell me I’m wrong. 🤷‍♀️"

And by 3:00 they were out of chicken sandwiches and asparagus.\nIt’s also very loud. Food is still 10/5.\nThis was also at the new location.\n\nMay 2021\nUh...10/10!! I would say this is my favorite restaurant in the city. Everything we ordered was delicious. I highly recommend the BBQ chicken sandwich AND the classic mac and cheese. The service was amazing!!

Restaurant was about 2/3rds full for Friday lunch, but our food took over an hour for three people, and our server seemed extremely unprepared in regards to the menu (seemed like she was new/ major lack of effective training)— multiple food and drink items were out on the menu but weren’t informed until we were ordering, and even the soup of the day was different than what we were told and the server never addressed it until after it hit the table. Fries were cold which made us believe the food had been waiting a while to be run, but otherwise the food tasted good.\nOverall disappointing visit, but I have enjoyed coming in the past, not sure if I’ll come again."

We sat outside, which was enjoyable, though we did have to deal with a bit of direct sunlight.\n\nThe highlights for us were the fried pickles and the croque madame—both delicious, and the portions were huge (easily enough for two people). On the other hand, my drink and the gravy dish we tried were less impressive.\n\nOverall, though, I’d certainly recommend giving Jacob’s Pickles a try. It’s a fun spot with hearty portions and great service."

            "text": "I have been wanting to try this spot for awhile so I was so pleased when I was in the area and able to snag a table early Saturday evening. I tried the cornbread, the okra, catfish tacos and the seasonal pumpkin biscuit beer. The beer was honestly the highlight of the meal, I seriously loved it so much. The okra was an incredible dish- I have only ever had deep fried okra and honestly didn’t know that there were other ways to prepare it but WOW. The seasoning was perfection and apparently the okra was pickled before it’s cooked which I think really evevates the flavors and yet it wasn’t too salty. It was cooked to the point of being a bit caremelized and crispy. Truly delicious. The only thing I’d say is it was a touch too oily for my tastes. And don’t get me wrong I am from the south so I get it, but to a point the extra oil becomes unnecessary. The cornbread was delicious and felt extremely gluttonous between the butter and cheese (that’s a good thing). I can’t say I’d recommend the catfish tacos but I would definitely go back to try something else. Not sure how the catfish was prepared but I have only ever had deep fried catfish and that’s how I prefer it and was expecting that type of more fluffy catfish that’s crispy on the outside. That was not the type of catfish that’s crispy was on these tacos, so they weren’t my favorite. I will say the portions are very generous- I’d want to come back with at least a few friends next time so we’re able to try more dishes! These three were more than enough for my friend and I. I also have to give props to the server, wish I got her name but she was awesome and everybody working there was really friendly. I hope to try it again next time I’m in the upper west side"

            "text": "Friends told me that this spot is known for its breakfast and brunch/lunch, especially the variety of egg dishes and their bread. To really evaluate a place, I think it’s important to start with a classic meal, so we ordered the traditional breakfast. Eggs: one plate with sausage and another with bacon. The portions were generous, and the eggs were excellent, cooked just right and full of flavor. Where the experience fell short was the bread. It was highlighted on the menu, so expectations were high. Unfortunately, it was underwhelming :( tasteless, and a little dry. Honestly, a simple slice of fresh ciabatta or sourdough would have elevated the whole plate.\nOn the brighter side, the cocktail I tried was delicious, and the service was outstanding. Our server was warm, professional, and genuinely joyful <3 , which added a lot to the experience. The atmosphere is also a big plus: lively, welcoming, and clearly a place where guests leave satisfied.\nWould I come back? Probably, but next time I’d skip the bread and try something different."

            "text": "The only redeeming quality—if you could call it that—of this place is the flavor of its food. Everything else, though, it severely misses the mark. From the moment we stepped in, the atmosphere was flooded with the constant clinking of bar glasses, the booming chatter that restricted any conversation, the crowded, small tables and the dim lights that made it so we could barely see our food. The whole place was crowded and loud. We were seated, and we ordered our food and drinks. The drinks arrived first, and severely missed the mark. The root beer had a mild taste of toothpaste, and the watermelon beer was nearly undrinkable. Then, our appetizers arrived. They had insane quantities of food, and looked more like entrees than appetizers. It’s almost like they designed all their food to be wasted. The taste was decent, with the fried pickles being greasy but manageable, the cornbread more reminiscent of a cornbread pizza than actual cornbread, and the green tomatoes being thick and slightly under seasoned. After a long time of waiting, our entrees arrived. The quantities were so unimaginably huge that I got sick just looking at the dishes. I mean, how much calories must be in every dish?? they gave us no warning on the huge quantities, making us order way too much food! Speaking of food, similarly to the appetizers, it was decent. The chicken and waffles was MASSIVE, with three French toasts stacked and two massive pieces of chicken. If you call that “generous portions,” that’s fine, but to me, that’s “ridiculous portions.” Simply way too much. The chicken was moist and juicy, probably the best food the whole meal, while the French toast was dense and cakey. The meatloaf was decent, but it was very beefy, and the sheer quantity caused us to waste a lot of the food. Overall, very disappointing experience. Do better Jacob’s pickles!! You have so much potential!!"

Possibly the best fried pickles I’ve had, they’re battered in something similar to hush puppies as opposed to just breaded like most places. Absolutely enormous deviled eggs. Our sandwiches were massive as was the mac & cheese. We 100% needed boxes to take all our food home. I wish I didn’t get so full so I could continue eating. Can’t wait to find out what dessert is like but it was impossible to fathom today. The restaurant itself is designed with such a great vibe and aesthetic. Our server, Jordan, was lovely, polite and prompt, an absolute delight to have help us. Impeccable service. I can’t sing his praises enough. Not only all of this, but the music was a vibe. Every song was a hit and at various points I was dancing a little while eating. Whomever made this playlist has amazing taste. They’re moving but I’ll definitely be hunting this place down at their new location."

The Sausage Gravy is also noteworthy, you’d think it would weigh you down but it actually lifts you up. I always get the Hot Chicken Biscuit Sandwich and it never disappoints.

Both dishes were absolutely outstanding. The portions were so generous that we had more than enough to share, and my son eagerly sampled both of our meals, with plenty of leftovers to spare. If only our hotel had a microwave, I would’ve loved to take the leftovers back to enjoy later! The staff, including our server, were incredibly friendly and attentive, which made the experience even more delightful. I’m already looking forward to returning to try other tempting dishes like the poutine, buffalo mac 'n' cheese, and fried Oreos.
