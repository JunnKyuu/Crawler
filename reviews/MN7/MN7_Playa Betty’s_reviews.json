I wholeheartedly recommend Playa Betty and if you’re lucky, you’ll be seated in Josh’s section."

With 3 hungry young boys and 1 tired baby we made our way through the front door.  Usually, our crew is met with a deep breath as the restaurant knows there is a 50/50 chance that our table will be rowdy, BUT not Playa Betty.  We were met with a huge \"Hello and Welcome!\" and every family member received a fist bump from one of the waiters.\n\nOnce seated, Craig greeted our table and informed us of happy hour, which I took part in.  He quickly came back to tell me that the keg was being changed so it would take a few more minutes but I didnt mind trying the other beer instead.  After receiving my beer, Craig returned with a sample of my original order now that the keg was changed, and he said, \"I didn't want you to miss out on what you originally wanted!\"\n\nCraig was an incredible server, acknowledging all of the kids that ranged from 1.5 to 12 years old.  The whole restaurant catered to our kids and made them feel welcomed and appreciated.   Only one of my kids got a kids meal which came with an ice cream at the end.  Since this restaurant knows kid dynamics they voluntarily brought out ice cream for the other 3 free of charge.\n\nThe atmosphere was absolutely incredible and would work for any occasion from family dinner to night out with friends after work.  The food was out of this world good and the family could not get enough of the street corn.\n\nI highly recommend this place and will absolutely be going back!"

It was cutting it close to the cut off time but the hostess informed us we could still order before 7P. The server came at 6:58P for the order and put in burgers and Paloma’s. The burger was not like the picture in the other review. It was missing meat. It was burnt and it lacked any flavor or taste. It was very disappointing. The server never came to ask how it was. I asked another server for the manager and when no one came I decided to go to the hostess stand and mention that I won’t be ordering more food as I was left with a poor taste in my mouth from a burned burger. We were starving and wanted to order more food but we left and ate a neighboring restaurant. The staff wanted us to come back next time rather than handling the issue on this same visit. It was a very unpleasant experience. The picture I have doesn’t show the burnt meat but it does show that the cheese was burnt black. It was all lettuce and bread and very little meat. I think it does show that its size is small and it is like a mini slider with nothing but bread and lettuce."

I loved the frozen Paloma this was so good. The margarita was good too and strong. There were a lot of items on the menu that looked delicious but we only ordered enchiladas and the fish tacos. The green sauce on the enchiladas made it for us, but next time I don’t think we’ll order them. The bean and rice side was not it, though. Very bland and no flavor at all. However, the fish tacos were amazing. I’m definitely coming back for the tacos and to try other items on the menu. Overall a good place just don’t get the beans and rice."

Every time I return, I'm pleasantly surprised by their ability to keep things fresh and exciting on the menu. Their latest addition, the brunch menu, is no exception. It's a true smorgasbord with options catering to all tastes, and each dish is a delightful fusion of beachy flavors.\n\nFor the health-conscious, the breakfast burrito bowl stands out as a nutritious yet satisfying choice. On the flip side, the French toast is a sinful indulgence that is worth every bite. One thing not to miss is their customizable guacamole; where they bring you a tray full of goodies to allow you to tailor the guac to your exact preferences.\n\nStepping into Playa Betty's for brunch feels like a mini getaway to the sunny shores of California. Highlights include their inventive twist on chicken and waffles with the fried chicken and churros, a refreshing cactus mimosa, and, of course, their stellar taco selection.\n\nIf you're in search of a great brunch spot on the Upper West Side that ticks all the boxes – relaxed atmosphere, reasonable prices, and generous portions – look no further than Playa Betty's."

            "text": "Had a great lunch here on a weekday afternoon. Huge place so getting a table wasn’t an issue. Lots of vegetarian options. Guacamole and chips were great. We got it with the salsa trio and they were fresh and full of flavor. Probably the best I’ve had for such a simple and standard starter. For the mains, the avocado taco was a great sounding option but was surprisingly lacking in flavor. Next time I’ll get the salsa trio with it for the missing flavor. The vegan enchilada was really good, although would have loved for the fresh veggies to have been roasted more with some char.\n\nOverall, knowing this was Baja/Cali Mex, had expected milder flavors than the usual spicy Tex Mex but be aware to avoid disappointment if you’re expecting a lot of heat.\n\nGreat meal and would certainly return."

He was patient, kind, and had a great vibe about him. i would definitely recommend a trip here for any meal. the service and food will NOT disappoint!"

Great waitress though and some great offerings. The wings weren’t as good as the photos but the avocado and queso dip were great. The tacos though are where it’s at. 🌮 😎 nice place and the comedy club downstairs is great. Errors with QR codes and submitting payments though."

She was attentive,  friendly and a wealth of knowledge with both the menu and wine pairings. She made our evening extra special while we celebrated my mom’s 75th birthday. If you haven’t been to Playa Betty’s—you must go, and ask for Zoe."

I liked the fact that they sent the guacamole with all the ingredients in the side, so you can get to choose what you want and the amount. The tacos we ordered were very good and tasty. The drinks were nice, but the frozen volcano one I got I couldn’t finish drinking it. It’s was super sweet and I couldn’t enjoy it. I drank not even half. But the other drink was good. But I wasn’t lucky 🥲"

The floors were oddly slippery as well, not too sure what that was about. It was also really loud (music) with nothing good playing. Wasnt really my vibe."
