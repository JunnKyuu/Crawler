The prices are very reasonable, the wine selection is great. David is an incredible server and you will be lucky to be served by him. If you want a classic Italian whole in the wall don’t look any further!"

David was our charming server and he came in with on point recs— from the wine (Chianti) to the food (Tagliatelle Bolognese)! It was the best Italian dinner I’ve had outside of Rome and would come back in a heartbeat."

            "text": "I arrived a little early around 4:30, and since it wasn’t crowded at that time, I was able to enjoy a quiet and relaxed meal.\nFor appetizers, we had pizza, fried buffalo cheese, and chicken livers. For the main dishes, we ordered tagliatelle con gamberi, paccheri con ricotta, and vermicelli alle vongole. Everything was delicious and well-prepared. The chicken liver might not be for everyone, but since I personally enjoy dishes made with liver, I was very satisfied.\nThe service was also excellent. The only minor inconvenience is that the restaurant accepts cash only, but since it’s worth preparing cash for, I think it’s definitely a place worth visiting."

            "text": "Celeste is a restaurant for anyone who loves and appreciates food. The love that the owner, staff, and chefs have for their craft is palpable from walking in the door. This isn't some generic review where I hit five on everything for a free dessert (though a review of any kind does net you a free dessert), I really would give each five stars. The food is sourced locally from fresh ingredients, yet is still relatively inexpensive for the superb quality. The service is perfect. Busboys are precise and move with a purpose while our server, David, was charming and charismatic without either subtracting from his ability to manage his tables and deliver things in a timely manner. The atmosphere is bright, welcoming, and oozes style. If you think you should go here, you should. It makes me happy that people care this much about dining as is necessary to create a dining experience such as this."

The food even better, my tagliatelle with shrimp and goat cheese is a must try, never have I seen that anywhere in my 21 years on the earth. I highly recommend giving Celeste a go, with friends with family, with that special someone, it’s good for all occasions!"

The watermelon salad was refreshing with a perfect balance of flavors, and the lasagna — one of the best I’ve ever had! Soft, rich in sauce, and full of authentic homemade taste.
