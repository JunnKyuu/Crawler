Wife was craving stuffed artichoke  So we started with a stuffed artichoke and the stuffed meatball and they were delicious. Artichoke could’ve had another couple minutes to really heat up core but was delicious. Nice and lite sauce very tasty.\nStuffed meatball was also great. We ended with artichoke rizoto and it was  creamy nice chunks of artichoke hearts very good."

Salad, appetizers and pasta course was served family style and they took orders for the choice of entree.  I had  filet of sole oreganota and it was delicious.  The meatball appetizer was also great.  My favorite was the fried zucchini because they cut it so thin, probably using a \"vegettie\" type of tool, and then fry it so it is perfectly crispy and light.  I'm looking forward to going back on a happier occasion."

After my pasta was served, even though I and my husband asked for parmesan cheese, the waiter never returned with it. I needed to go and look for someone to give me the cheese. The dirty dishes were piling up on our table. Nobody even came and asked if we want another drink, or fill up our water. In restaurant where you pay $100+ for your meal, one should be provided with adequate service. Sadly, this location of Aunt Butchie's is a big miss when it comes to service. Very disappointing considering amazing quality of food."

            "text": "it’s a shame to be writing such a terrible review, but I have to be completely honest. My mom went for dinner tonight with four of my aunts and got drugged. She had one drink, ordered a second, had a sip of it, and started to feel violently ill. She went in the bathroom, throwing up, confused, crying, and shaking. She was unsure of her surroundings and what was happening to her. we took the food to go and left the restaurant immediately to take her to the hospital. She was dazed and confused and had no idea what was happening. She clearly had been drugged. I called the restaurant and asked for the manager to kindly let him know that this is what happened and to please watch the cameras or watch the bar because something is going on there. He laughed at me, refused to help me, said that these type of things don’t happen at his restaurant and made it a joking matter. I told him that I was not looking to make a spectacle out of anything, I just wanted to let him be aware of what was going on in their establishment. I also did not accuse any of the staff there for doing this, as it could have been anyone sitting by the bar. These types of things happen even in restaurants where you wouldn’t imagine they would take place. I definitely will be getting in touch with the owner as I know him from my neighborhood that I grew up with in Brooklyn to let him know that his staff was completely unresponsive and rude and refused to help and also let him know that this is what is taking place in his restaurant. I’m truly so disappointed. We are a long time customers of aunt butchies, from when they started back in the day in Brooklyn. it saddens me to have to write this kind of review, but the manager Angelo really pushed me over the edge. He was extremely rude and hung up on me, refusing to help me or say that this possibly could have happened in the restaurant. Please watch your drinks there and be careful. This is not a joking matter. Something terrible could happen to somebody if they are drugged and they are alone or don’t have the right people with them to take them home to safety."

They seemed to have adequate staff for the amount of tables. Each time they left, it would take them forever to come back for us to ask for anything else. They were nice though when we were able to get a hold of them. The dishes were hit or miss. The free bread was delicious so we had high hopes for the pizza. We ordered a basic margherita pizza and it was awful. It was small, more like a personal pizza. The crust was thick, hard, and crunchy (not in a good way) but the middle was soggy. Don’t know how they managed that. Tried the stuffed meatball and that was a disappointment also. I was expecting melt mozzarella to ooze out but it was just a lump of ricotta. On the plus side, the calamari and rigatoni aunt butchies were delicious. The portions were big."

Alex had the Sunday Sauce pasta. The meatballs and sausage were delicious as was my eggplant parmigiana. The portions are enormous. Great value!!! We finished with cannolis. Heavenly!! Our gracious host Tara made the meal complete. We unconditionally recommend Aunt Butchies of Brooklyn."

But I ordered some food here the other day and while I was eating I chomped down on a staple that was in my pizza dough there is no way of communicating with anyone for help and it was after waiting 2 hours for my delivery I was pretty upset and it ruined my entire meal ... if you look at the picture that's what I chewed on and had to spit out...super disappointed how did that staple end up in my pizza dough..."

It was a bit chilly as our table was by the window and we came on a cold day.  There is an extra charge if you pay with the card, as a suggestion, bring cash. Other than that, it is a great family restaurant, I will be coming back."

I'll be back many times.\n\nUpdate 8/14/2021\n\nWe recently hosted a baby shower here for my wife. The staff was friendly, attentive, and very professional. Joe, our personal waiter, was the best. We never felt neglected or underserved at all. The food was great as always. Never a complaint about the food and our guests were raving about how great it was. Lastly, our hostess Tara was excellent. She helped us plan the event from start to finish. She answered all our questions and assisted us with all the details. Our shower wouldn’t have been such a success without her. This combination of professionalism, service, and great food are just a few of the many reasons why we’ll be back for dinner again, and why we’ll host our future events here. Definitely consider Aunt Butchies for your events."
