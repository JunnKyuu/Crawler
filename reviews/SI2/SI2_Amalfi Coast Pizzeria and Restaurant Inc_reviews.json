The place was empty and the tables needed to be cleaned. A man who wasn’t working but just watching TV and manning the register seemed to be an owner of some sort. The cook was working harder than the other 2 men in there. The pizza was just okay the sauce needed something to bring a tang out from the tomatoes but at least the pizza was cooked properly. (Big Boys Review: Sauce tastes great! Fried calamari was delicious and crispy and tender LOVED it! Service was fast and staff was friendly and made me feel like family! A great little pizzeria.)"
