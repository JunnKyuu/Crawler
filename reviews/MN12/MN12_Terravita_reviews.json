Their take on Latino and Mediterranean cuisine was so impressive — every dish had a journey of flavors. I honestly felt like Remy in that Ratatouille scene, trying to decipher all the different notes in each bite.\n\nThe service made the experience even better. Angelica, our server, was incredibly accommodating and caring. She paid attention to every little need we had and went out of her way to make sure we felt welcome — even when we thought we were being a bother, she reassured us we weren’t at all.\n\nAnd a big shout-out to Sergio at the bar — he crafted excellent drinks and tailored them perfectly to our preferences.\n\nFrom the food to the drinks to the service, everything was top-notch. I can’t recommend this place enough for a special night out!"

The short rib croquettes were amazing, shrimp plantain baskets were also amazing and I almost never eat shrimp. I had oxtail risotto one night, and the whole branzino last night. Both were really good, tasty dishes. Awesome presentation but great flavors balanced pretty well. Cigar old fashion is one of the best old fashions I’ve ever had around this world. Highly recommend"

There were two doors, one which I attempted to open but was locked and I thought the restaurant was closed because of the storm we were having, but thankfully after 5 minutes, I opened the right door and was greeted by Mr. Christopher.  He was the waiter and very pleasant and helpful.  After I placed my orders, I asked where the washroom/lavatory was, and I am pleased to announce that the washroom was clean, smelled lovely, spacious, had tissue, and soap.  I ordered the tuna tartare and the cauliflower and had a lychee martini.  Compliements to the chef(s)!  The only thing was the tuna tatare was a wee-bit too salty, but for MY taste.  The martini was on point-Ms. Paola was the bartender, and I was very much pleased with her drinks--so much so that I ordered another drink: the Hisbiscus Margarita.  Kaylee, who brought my appetizer, was so sweet!  I had, for an entrée, steak frites with truffle fries and salad.  Since I had eaten up all my appetizers, I was only able to eat my truffle fries (yum) and dessert.  I took the steak frites and mesclun salad home.  Speaking of dessert, I had the Coconut Panna Cotta.  It was very nice; there was Suger Smacks or Golden Crisp (or it's generic equivalent) cereal on the top, which took me way back to my young days, but I liked it very much.\n\nAll in all, the restaurant was just simply perfect!  Not only perfect, but clean, bright, airy. The music was at a comfortable tone, and the tunes were nice.  As I sat at my table, I could see passersby out the window look with wonderment as to what Terravita was.  As I was finishing, more customers started to come in.  Terravita, literally, is a breath of fresh, clean air in the neighbourhood.  Thanks, Terravita and Christopher, Paola, and Kaylee.  I'll be back, but with a bigger crowd! 💯💯💯💯💯✌🏽✌🏽✌🏽✌🏽Job very well done!"

            "text": "After witnessing a concert at the United Palace, we headed to Terravita based on a recommendation. There were five of us, but two had already eaten and simply accompanied us, which means only three of us dined. For starters, we ordered the mushroom hummus and truffle and cheese fries. As our main courses, we went for the steak and fries and the duck fried rice. We also ordered a hazy IPA and a Tempranillo wine.\n\nThe interior of the place is quite lovely, giving off that fine dining vibe.\n\nWhen our appetizers arrived, they brought us the hummus we had ordered, along with another one with lamb that we didn’t request. Furthermore, they brought the fries we ordered, along with tacos we didn’t ask for. We had to call the waiter twice to explain what had happened. So far, so good. My beer arrived; I had ordered a hazy IPA, but they brought me a lager… not even close. Once again, we had to call the waiter to fix the issue. The hummus was delicious, that’s the truth, but it was annoying that they brought us things we didn’t order. When the hanger steak came, it came with another plate of tacos we didn’t request, and that was like, “What’s wrong with the waiter, did he get everything wrong? Was he not listening, or did he want to give us more food for some reason? I don’t know, and we’ll never know.” We asked for the bill after the duck rice and left, laughing a bit and a bit irritated. Oh, the final check included drinks we never ordered, so once again, we had to call the waiter to explain and fix the inconvenience.\n\nAll of this is to say that we quite enjoyed the food and drinks, but the service was rather clumsy, careless, and unfocused. Besides that, they didn’t treat us poorly; in fact, everyone was very friendly. It’s just that we had a waiter who seemed to be on the moon rather than at Terravita. Would I go back? Yes, but I’d choose a different spot 😂."
