Shared calamari (excellent because they were not overbreaded, were large, and came with half a lemon), good side of broccoli rabe, and pasta alla Norcia ( good but short on the sausage and the place the dish is named  for. Bread was flavorful, and the table water was filtered and excellent.\nWhy a lower rating than the food deserves? First of all the service is rushed and a bit relentless, as if controlled by a timer in the kitchen.\nSecond, the tip options on our bill started at 20 %.\nProbably a great place to have a quick lunch."

Stek przygotowany perfekcyjnie, pełna profeska! Na deser czekoladowy mus i tiramisu – oba przepyszne i idealne na zakończenie wieczoru.

So I don’t think I should’ve waited at all for water. Because it was very warm outside and yet empty INSIDE the restaurant.

My guest had the linguine bolognese, which she also expressed was a great dish. I’ve come here before, and the food was amazing then as well as it is now. This might be my new favorite restaurant. It’s great for dates, even big parties. I might say I’d even solo dine here, that’s how nice it is 😎 oh and amazing job from my server Kristelyn!"

It was incredibly kind, I know places don't do that, so it just shows how kind the staff were. We got some lovely wine & a spritz, then we ended up order the same Rigatoni dish with Vodka sauce, Chicken, and sun dried tomatoes, delicious! Everyone who came by to check made us feel special and welcomed. We never felt rushed out, and when we left we were given sweet waves as if we were regulars who had been coming there for years.

The atmosphere, lighting, and wonderful music by Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Bobby Darin really captivated us. The service couldn’t have been better, and our food was exceptionally delicious. I had a Mediterranean salad, and my husband said his Caesar Salad was worthy of a Michelin star. We also shared the ahi tuna tartare appetizer, which was super delicious. Their homemade, paper-thin potato chips were so good that I asked for more. I look forward to coming back soon and trying other items on their menu."

Lights are dimmed and the seating is just enough space in between you and others that allows for a more private dining experience.\n\nWe had River help us with everything from welcoming us in, to seating us, to serving us. He went above and beyond to accommodate us and make my partners birthday special.\n\nThe food was great. The Nonna’s meatballs were just perfect, not too bland or overpowering with seasonings it was in this light tomato sauce(tasted a bit like marinara but not quite). The calamari I normally like it fried a bit more but that’s my personal preference.\n\nThe mashed potatoes are creamy but light and fluffy. Steak was great when they made it over. The drinks were great. If you’re not a heavy drinker and want to try a fruity cocktail definitely go for a Brazilian Breeze cocktail. I personally loved the 1699 Sidecar, it was stronger for those who like their drinks stronger and it has a perfect touch of citrus.\n\nDefinitely recommend and will be returning for brunch."

The sauce was delicious and amazingly flavorful. Left full and v delighted. Next time I'll be here with family."

We started with the grilled watermelon salad and then had the eggplant Parmesan and Rigatoni Pollo Pazzo. Dishes we would recommend. Great environment for a date night, dinner with friends or would be delicious as take out. Highly recommend."

            "text": "Having chosen to sit at the sidewalk seating area, in glorious weather, that shouldn't mean not having access to waiting staff when you need. But for some reason it does here. I asked for some bread and oil. The bread had clearly been pre-cut some three or four hours earlier and was as stale as can be. By the time I found some help to remedy this (the table cleaning staff, who took the bread away and still fully squirted and wiped down the table next to me before taking my complaint indoors), my entree arrived before the new bread. I didn't want it anymore.\n\nShort rib and mash sounds great, but it's not on the rib, it's not much to get excited by and I left half of it. A single lump of galatinous 'cheap-cut' slow cooked meat.\n\nUnderwhelming in the extreme. I will not be back."

            "text": "I recently had a wonderful experience at Bocca di Bacco that exceeded all expectations. From the moment we arrived, Eduardo and his team went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Their friendliness and attention to detail truly made our evening special.\nThe quality of the food was outstanding. Every dish we tried was delicious and thoughtfully prepared. The Mediterranean salad was fresh and vibrant, with crisp greens and a perfectly balanced vinaigrette. The mushroom truffle pasta was a standout-rich, creamy, and bursting with earthy truffle flavor. The lasagna was hearty and comforting, with layers of tender pasta, savory sauce, and just the right amount of cheese.\nWhat really set the experience apart was the staff. Eduardo and his team were not only knowledgeable about the menu but also genuinely warm and attentive. They accommodated our early arrival without hesitation and made sure every aspect of our meal was enjoyable. The ambiance was lively yet cozy, making it an ideal spot for both groups and intimate dinners.\nOverall, Bocca di Bacco delivered a fantastic dining experience with high-quality Italian cuisine and exceptional hospitality. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for great food and a welcoming atmosphere in New York City. We will definitely be returning!"
