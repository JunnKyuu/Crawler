Our waiter Emerson did an amazing job taking our orders and getting them to our table quickly. Personally, I got their Cinnamon French toast with vanilla ice cream on top and the pumpkin vodka RumChata drink (can’t remember what’s it’s actually called lol), but both had an amazing balance between flavors. My girlfriend got the chicken and waffles. In her own words, “ I would describe it as good. The chicken was really crispy and it came with a nice sweet sauce on the side. Very large portions.” Overall this is an amazing atmosphere and they were playing Harry Potter on the tv’s."

It’s a cool place, quite an eccentric decor but not over the top, with a good bustling Sunday brunch vibe going on thanks to the sunshine. The menu seemed great, lots of classic American breakfast dishes to choose from, although I skipped the pancakes and waffles and had the breakfast sandwich with home fries - this was great, and the homes fries are delicious, little roasted/fried skin-on potato chunks which really hit the spot. The steak & eggs and the avocado toast looked tasty too. I really enjoyed stopping off at Mom’s, the barman had good chat and it was great as a solo traveller today. Highly recommended!"

The milkshakes are absolutely over the top (in the best way) and the portions are super generous—you definitely won’t leave hungry. Service was friendly and the atmosphere is lively without being overwhelming. The only reason I’m giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because it can get a little pricey for what you’re getting, and the wait can be long during peak hours. Still, definitely worth a visit if you’re in the mood for comfort food with a twist!"

Real handmade waffles, well seasoned, crispy chicken and the food was HOT! I also enjoyed the sauce that I got on the side for the chicken. I don't exactly know what it was but it was really good. And it's some type of sweet a little bit spicy syrup for the waffles that I did like as well. My server was polite and accommodating but I forgot his name. We were greeted by a nice young lady who seemed friendly at the door. I didn't really care for the atmosphere too much. The background was a bit noisy with lots of chatter and it was pretty crowded but I can see why because the food was just delicious! In my opinion, I found the prices to be a little pricey for me personally but it was worth every penny. I also got the blue electric lemonade which was really good. Had a nice little buzz going on.

I visited for brunch and enjoyed a margarita along with their Woodland omelet, which was quite delicious, especially with the bechamel sauce. While it didn't completely exceed my expectations( sorry couldn't give 5 stars for the food. But 4 is still really solid) and the food was enjoyable, and the atmosphere along with the service provided by the staff were excellent. The ambiance was cozy and comfortable, which generally contributes to a positive experience. I would certainly consider returning if I am in the vicinity again, as it is conveniently located near the theater district, and I am interested in exploring other menu options."

My partner ordered shortrib grilled cheese with sweet potato fries. Both of us substituted salad for fries, because who needs salad with these dishes 😅.   Both meals were delightful, although if I knew it was a  burger patty ( not a patty rolled fresh with ground beef), I would have done medium rare instead of well. It could have used more of the spicy sauce it was a dot in the middle so the whole burger was not spicy just the center. While we ate our milkshakes seemed to catch alot of attention from those that walked by us. We both agreed that the milkshakes were the most enjoyable part of our meal. I would be interested in other shakes and touching their all day brunch next time we are catching a show. We decided tl eat outside because of the beautiful weather. Our server was very attentive and checked on us periodically.  Definitely a chill atmosphere and cozy inside and out"

Check out a few of the plates I explored.\n\nCinnamon French Toast:\nThis specialty French toast is topped with apple compote, cinnamon toast crunch crumble, and whipped cream.\n\nEach bite sent my taste buds to paradise.\n\nThere is so much flavor you can either have them as is, or feel free to pour as much or as little syrup as you desire.\n\nChicken & Bacon Waffle:\nIt’s time in indulge in this southern classic.\n\nComprised of four triangular Belgian waffle slices, it also includes boneless fried chicken with tender white meat and slabs of crispy bacon hidden beneath.\n\nThe béchamel sauce and cholula honey are the backbone to this breakfast plate.\n\nBedrock Pancakes:\nThese pancakes are a page right out of history.\n\nThere was a variety of berries and a side of whipped cream with fruity pebbles toppings.\n\nThe popular cereal was also mixed in with the pancake batter, which added more flavor, sweetness, and a slight crunch.\n\nAnd I had a yabba-dabba-doo time clearing this plate!\n\nAs a bonus, this bar has several retro decorations.\n\nMost of the patrons should instantly recognize this gnarly memorabilia.\n\nIt’s like visiting an antique shop where you get to admire this awesome merchandise from prior generations.\n\nOutdoor seating is available, but I highly recommend dining inside so you can admire the souvenirs.\n\nThis was a flawless experience exploring breakfast at a bar and it surpassed my expectations by a long shot.\n\n#momskitchenandbar #midtownmanhattan #timessquare #breakfast #bedrockpancakes #pancakes #FrenchToast #cinnamonfrenchtoast #waffles #chickenandbaconwaffles #localbar #foodstagram #nycfoodie #LocalSpots"

The decor is playful but cozy, and it really sets the tone for what turned out to be a memorable meal.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious and portions were very generous. I went for a burger, which was juicy, full of flavor, and stacked just right – exactly the kind of comfort food you hope for in a spot like this. My wife tried one of their bowls, and it was fresh, hearty, and perfectly balanced. You can tell they put real care into the ingredients and presentation, even when it’s classic comfort food.\n\nThe milkshakes and cocktails are another highlight. They’re fun, creative, and taste just as good as they look. Definitely something you don’t want to miss if you stop by.\n\nWhat really stood out, though, was the staff. Everyone we interacted with was friendly, upbeat, and attentive without ever being pushy. They made us feel welcome the whole time and kept the positive energy flowing.\n\nIn short: Mom’s Kitchen and Bar is way more than just a place to eat – it’s an experience. Great food, awesome drinks, fun atmosphere, and genuinely nice people. We’ll absolutely be coming back, and we’d recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxed and tasty spot in New York."

            "text": "Went here for breakfast/brunch. We were seated immediately. Our waitress came over and took drink orders and returned shortly for food orders. The food came out within a decent amount of time. The pancakes were pretty good. I ordered a side of bacon which wasn’t that good. It was bits and pieces and was hard and over cooked. For the price of it, it definitely should’ve been wayyyy better. If you look at my reviews I order bacon everywhere so for me not to send this back and deal with it is big on my part lol. The waffle was good also. My other quarrel is, I don’t like whip cream…consistency thing…so I had that removed. It came correct but I had no syrup. I had to wait until I found my waitress and then she had other tables to tend to and obviously had to fill the container, etc. Needless to say, my husband was halfway through his waffle by the time I got it and then it was lukewarm. Maybe give syrup on the side or ask. I would’ve assumed it came with it but….yeah. If I returned, I would try something else."

The macaroni and cheese pancakes were not that great. The macaroni and cheese was delicious, but the pancakes and bits of sausage in it and I already had a side of sausage and it was just overkill and too many flavors mixed together. Outside of the service being excellent, I don’t think I would come back again."

The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I feel like perhaps they could do something to dull the noise factor inside (why we chose to sit outside) but that being said, from start to finish, we had a lovely experience!  I really enjoyed the omelette with wild mushrooms, smoked Gouda and topped with Bechamel sauce and my friend equally enjoyed his Croque Madam! Although we didn’t really need an appetizer (portions are plentiful), we loved the cheese curds starter. The drinks were also lovely but what really made the experience most enjoyable was our server, Jonathan.  He was super friendly, kind and very efficient.  We look forward to coming back soon!"

These dishes could have been overly sickly but somehow the flavour balances kept us going til the end. It’s an awesome spot for brunch if you’re in Hells Kitchen. They also do dinner options and we’d go again to try that if we were back. Service was excellent too, you’re doing an amazing job."

I loved their fried chicken sandwich and home fries with a side of aioli sauce! The service and staff were amazing, very friendly, attentive, and welcoming. Another plus for this place is that it’s very affordable compared to many other brunch spots.\nThey have a wide menu and their ambiance is welcoming for families and friends. Definitely check this spot out if you are around Times Square looking for a great, affordable and delicious place to eat brunch."

The condiments were in a vintage lunch box which was really cool. I had the short rib sandwich and it was good. I would recommend upgrading to the fries. The cheese steak egg rolls were great! The sauce that came with it really put it over the top! I can't wait to come back and try a milkshake!"
