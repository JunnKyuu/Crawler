The building has the original wooden bar, tile, glass and ceiling.\nThe bartender is a friendly man who explained the history of the restaurant and the history of the picture of the ship 🚢 hanging near the bar.\nAlthough we didn’t order food, everything we saw being delivered looked delicious. We entered around noon and the restaurant was quite busy. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the history.\nIt’s a great place to have a drink.🥃 ( and food)"

            "text": "We visited The Landmark Tavern on 11th Avenue. The steak was flavorful and well prepared, and the beer – especially the dark Guinness – was excellent. The burger, on the other hand, was nothing remarkable. The fried chicken fingers were decent, but very simple, and the fries came overcooked. What really disappointed me was the side dish: the menu listed “steamed vegetables,” which normally suggests peppers, tomatoes, corn, or maybe eggplant. Instead, I was served a full plate of broccoli. Since I cannot tolerate broccoli, this should have been clarified on the menu. A more accurate name would be Steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli."

The place has that lovely, old-fashioned personal touch and would highly recommend it to all groups, there is a kids' menu and it is wheelchair user-friendly."

I was greeted and served by Pratap, and he was very welcoming, friendly, and attentive. I ordered the Corned Beef and Cabbage, and it was very good. The Corned Beef was really the star of the dish as it was cooked perfectly and just melted in my mouth. The menu isn't too large, but it looks like the portions are very generous for the prices. I absolutely loved the atmosphere of this place where it gives off a classic pub look. I definitely recommend it as this is one of those places that is great for a quick bite, a date night, or just grab a couple of drinks."

I usually get the fish & chips and to be honest, it’s amongst the best in the city. So much flavor and with a side of salad to keep it extra flavorful.\nThe bangers and mash are also a bar classic if you’re more on the heavy side of a meal.\n\nI am not a big beer drinker; however, when I go to Landmark, I must always get the “Landmark Ale”. It’s a perfect light side beer and just hits well after one of their classic meals.\n\nPeter has been there for quite some time and usually looks out with a round on the house before I leave at the end of the night.\n\nIf you want to feel as if you’re stepping back in time, not be bothered and just enjoy a beer while watching a game? Head to Landmark.\nThe draft beers, fish and chips do not disappoint and more importantly, it’s a price of NYC as well as Hell’s Kitchen history."

The staff are so friendly and helpful, that you feel like a regular the first time you come. There are so many bad bars as you walk towards the Theater District, but go further West and feel like you're slipping into a neighborhood tradition."
