On top of that, the tall skinny server had a moody attitude toward us.👎👎\n\nBTW, The food is tasty and authentic. 👍"

He has the best customer focus and was incredibly helpful during my wait time in the restaurant. I watched him greeting and serving everyone with genuine hospitality and a smile.\nAs for the food, it's consistently great! I've ordered from this restaurant more than 25 times, and the food is always a winner—the noodle dishes are my absolute favorite."

Even after moving away from New York, I make sure to stop by every time I’m in town visiting friends. I’ve never had a dish I didn’t enjoy here—everything is consistently delicious and comforting, like home-cooked food.\n\nOn my latest visit, we had the khao kha moo, ba mi poo, and khao soi—all packed with rich, authentic flavors. The restaurant is always busy, which says a lot, but now that you can make reservations in advance, it’s much more convenient.\n\nThis place truly never disappoints and remains a must-visit every time I’m back in the city."

While I have my usual Thai restaurant go tos, Pure Thai is now my favorite when it comes to their noodle soups! I've just recently tried both their beef and roasted pork soups with rice noodles and they were so delicious and comforting! They also do their Thai iced tea just right and have good vegetable spring rolls! Service is warm and friendly even if they get so packed and busy. The restroom is spacious and clean especially in their expanded section which we usually enjoy better. Can't wait to come back soon for my Thai noodle soup fix! :)"

When we pointed it out, he claimed we had ordered “mild” and not “not spicy.” Then, possibly the manager came over, instead of apologizing for the situation (we had only asked which plate was the non-spicy one) , she said that “mild” just means slightly spicy and that you can simply remove the chili. Excellent service, as you can tell.\nOn top of that, the service was slow, the food was terrible, and it took them 20 minutes just to pay. The entire staff was unprofessional."
