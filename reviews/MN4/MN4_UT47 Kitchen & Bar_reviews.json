            "text": "Outstanding in every aspect! Good was perfectly balanced, great options, varied, toward the healthier side without a sacrifice for taste. Service was a tiny bit slow to get started but then was attentive and precise. I had the #4 Sweet Bacon BLT: sweetness, acidity perfectly contrasted, with textures (bacon, multigrain bread, soft egg), and overall flavors precise and pleasant. There was a little surprise at the end: a perfect chewy, gooey, moist, chocolaty muffin/brownie to finish the meal off. Ambience also soft on the eyes, balanced, and civilized clientele. Highly recommend!"

            "text": "I ate here when it was in the former location and it wasn’t great for the following reasons: 1) it took roughly 20 minutes to put in an order. 2)   it took another 15 minutes for them to bring drinks like iced coffee. 3) it took another five minutes for them to let us know that they were out of several items. 4) we didn’t get the food delivered to the table until about an hour and 10 minutes after we initially sat down. The food (and presentation) was unnecessarily fussy.  There were 5 people (family) in this party.\n\nLast night I went to the new location on the corner of 47/9th Ave and I regret to write that we could have chosen a better restaurant again. No doubt this new location is larger and therefore cost more to rent. However, when we sat down, there was only one other table of two people. We had 3 people (friends). It’s “tapas-style” dishes like fried tofu nuggets and fried kimchi dumplings. So it’s high margin food and not too healthy or filling. It’s not a big menu, and we really should have looked closer at the menu when we chose to eat here. Again, the food (and presentation of the food) was unnecessarily fussy. We got 7 mostly fried tapas dishes (share) and  drinks. Gratuity was automatically included. The total was roughly $250."

            "text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5-Star Review for UT47 Kitchen & Bar\n\nAfter my doctor’s appointment, I decided to stop by UT47 Kitchen & Bar, where I've been savoring to visit. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warmth, professionalism, and a smile that instantly set the tone for an amazing experience.\n\nThe customer service was absolutely top-notch genuine, attentive, and full of positive energy. The food was fresh, flavorful, and clearly made with love from the kitchen. Every bite tasted like care vegan options that are hmm hmm good. How do they make the vegan pouch egg & hollandaise sauce?\n\nWhat really stood out to me was how smoothly everything ran with only two women working the floor Jasmine & Toshi. Just the two of them smiling, multitasking, serving, and keeping everything in perfect order. Toshi is a perfect ex.that language is NO BARRIER. Communication comes in many forms. Their grace under pressure was remarkable even with customers with huge dogs in a petite space. Jasmine made sure I was comfortable..\n\nI don’t know if these two ladies were my Angelic food angels that day, but either way, it’s definitely a reflection of management and great leadership. It shows when staff are happy, confident, and take pride in what they do that energy flows to every customer.\n\nI left full, happy, and genuinely impressed. I hope every time I come back, the food and service remain just the same. I have to find a way to add UT47 Kitchen & Bar into my budget 😅 Thank you, for a truly refreshing dining experience. I’ll definitely be back!\nAngelic"

In my opinion, this is the top breakfast spot in Hell's Kitchen/Times Square and possibly all of NYC.\n\nThe food is not only delicious but also visually appealing, making for great photos. They look pretty artistic. While the prices may be slightly higher than others, it’s worth paying. The owner's secret sauces add an extra layer of flavor to their sandwiches and eggs. I've shared BLT sandwiches with colleagues, and they all ask for more\n\nI would like to thank the owner for bringing this exceptional dining experience to the neighborhood and for maintaining its high standards."

I asked for a bourbon old fashion and was served a vermouth tasting thing. We only had the two drinks and our bill was 60 dollars. Felt completely ripped off. Would not recommend going to this place"

Lucky for me, they absolutely delivered in that regard.\n\nThis late night bar features a plethora of Korean options that would satisfy anyone. Aside from fancy drinks, there was a strong selection of dosirak meals for dinner that we all decided to go in on.\n\nMine included soy meat bulgolgi over rice with a vegan egg, served with a side of veggie gyoza, beansprouts, and pickled cucumbers. My meal came inside a large bentou box and I gotta say, it was a lot of food even for someone that was ready to ravage some morsels near midnight. The rice had such a great blend of flavors and the bulbolgi tasted just like how I remembered it once upon a time ago.\n\nBeing at night, service ended up being a bit slower but I don't blame them since it was mostly one or two individuals serving the entire bar. Be prepared for a small wait if you order food at night.\n\nI'd definitely return again if I wanted to enjoy some late night Korean in a very relaxed environment."

I have been vegan for 10 years. They accidentally gave me beef. They apologized and redid the order for me. I asked for it to just be made to go. Whatever, mistakes happen.\n\nBut I get home to realize YOU GAVE ME BEEF AGAIN!! I’m not sure if you guys thought this was funny to do this twice, but I’m never going here again. Honestly so upsetting and a little insulting to not be taken seriously.\n\nIf there’s a new management, get it together. Vegan friends, don’t go here. They obviously have some kind of issue in the kitchen, or just like messing with us. So so so sad and unfortunate. Was one of my favorite places in the neighborhood."

            "text": "Update (Augusy 2025)\nI revisited this spot after my first visit in December, now that I've moved to NYC. Unfortunately, it's not the same anymore. The new location across the street lacks the charm the old one had. The food was still decent, but not nearly as good as my last visit. Not sure if the chef has changed. Last time, everything was exceptional. I still remember how perfectly crispy and flavorful the potatoes were amd that I had ordered an extra plate. This time, everything just tasted... average. It went from being my favorite brunch spot in the city to just another place. To top it off, the bathroom was dirty. Sad and disappointed 😞. Downgrading the review to 3 stars.\n\nDecember 2024\nLoved the eggs benedict. It's really cute restaurant decor, too."

The service was good. The blueberry muffin was delicious. The sauce, which was served with a sandwich, was delicious."

I feel like the chef is so intentional with the combination of ingredients along with the presentation of every menu item. Overall portions are great, flavors are bursting, price point very fair. Fav items: bulgogi beef taco, beet salad, beef dumplings, any bfast Sammy…basically everything."

Every cocktail I’ve tried here has been excellent, but the espresso martini is a standout-they make it with freshly pulled espresso, so it’s extra rich and flavorful. Definitely a drink I’ll come back for!"

Fresh ingredients and good service. Could definitely use some fans in the summer time but theyre new and still figuring things out."

Friendly staff, cute decor and the best part is the delicious fusion food.\n\nMy favorite items here are the mermaid latte and the bulgogi beef tacos. I have been a regular that comes every other week and tried half of the menu, I have not had a bad dish here. Highly recommended."

            "text": "Comfort Fusion Korean Food is an absolute must-try.\n\nI finally made it there for dinner—though I’m usually a brunch person (they serve the best avocado toast I’ve ever had). But dinner did not disappoint. Every dish was fresh, flavorful, and thoughtfully prepared. Their happy hour menu is spot-on: a perfectly portioned meal and drink for just $23. I went for the tacos, while my husband enjoyed the bibimbap—both were delicious.\n\nBut the “comfort” extends beyond the food. We sat at the bar window on a beautiful evening, with the windows wide open to the street. Two of our neighbors from the building happened to pass by, and we ended up chatting with them, adding an unexpected social spark to the night. The owners themselves came over to greet us, which made the whole experience feel warm and genuinely welcoming.\n\nI love seeing local businesses flourish—especially when they're run by members of the Hell’s Kitchen community. Comfort Fusion is more than just a great meal; it’s a neighborhood gem and a true destination eatery."
