Das Restaurant ist unglaublich gemütlich und der französische Gastgeber hat uns sehr aufmerksam und freundlich empfangen und bewirtet. Das Essen war sehr gut - vor allem der Caesar Salat und das hausgemachte Tiramisu waren köstlich, ebenso der Wein und der Digestiv - und alles wirklich sehr bezahlbar. Ein echter Geheimtipp und unbedingt empfehlenswert!"

There's a separated room which has more tables but not by much. The place is decorated very intimately with brick floors and walls.\n\nMENU:\nTraditional Italian.\n\nFOOD:\nMista e Pere Salad\nAKA salad with thinly sliced pears. Nice & refreshing choice.\n\nBurrata Special\nFresh prosciutto and a ball of fresh mozzarella on top and drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Simply delish.\n\nFettuccine Ai Funghi\nHomemade pasta in a light cream sauce and topped with fresh parsley. I'm not a fan of homemade pasta as I've never had it cooked perfect. This time around the pasta was a little underdone and had a dry, coarse texture. The taste was good and the portion pretty small. All the pastas were listed at $12.50. I'd rather pay more to receive more.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe 3-in-one male bartender/waiter/bus boy was friendly & professional. He could've been the owner or manager of the place from what I got.\n\nOVERALL:\nGood price, small portioned entrees, and open late."

It’s one of those places that not only everything on the menu is mind blowing-ly delicious but it’s also one of those places that the service is the main reason to come back! For dessert, get the chocolate soufflé (seriously, might sound basic and not authentic but they have, hands down, the best lava cake in entire nyc). The only (big) issue for me is the shared seating, I’m not the type that feels comfortable rubbing elbows with strangers and have meals while the couple 5 inches from me talking about their relationship. Gladly was still summer and there were tables outside."

Ein Lächeln suchten wir die ganze Zeit vergebens.\n\nInkl. 20% Trinkgeld (war nicht meine Entscheidung) haben wir für eine Flasche eines einfachen Nero D'Avola, 1 Ceasar Salad, 1 Pasta mit Shrimps, Muscheln und Sepia in \"Safransoße\" 🧐🤔, 1x Lasagne und 1x gebr. Fischfilet mit Spinat sowie 2 Gläser Eis mit Cola und 2 Flaschen Wasser 256,- $ ausgegeben.\n\nVor 2 Tagen in Paris hätten wir dafür ein Essensfeuerwerk im Sternebereich bekommen.\n\nMan kann nicht grundsätzlich abraten, aber eine Empfehlung wird es definitiv nicht. Es gibt sicherlich genug Alternatuven in der Umgebung.\n\nDie Fotos zeigen den direkten Vergleich aus Paris (Alcoryllis Ristorante Italiano) und dem Briciola (die gelbe Pasta).

She had a lamb pasta dish and since I don't eat meat had the pasta with mushrooms (generous amount, fresh and flavorful!). I usually don't like most restaurants that overspice, oversalt and overdo any flavors that should be subtle. And Briciola hit the right note of invitingly flavorful without drowning the natural taste of ingredients! It is small and cozy, but if you get there at the right time of day early in the week I think you will reap the best out of this restaurant. Since it is on a side street and not on the avenue it is also not as \"high octane\" energy as other places are in that area."

But they always have specials, staff are patient and friendly, and I have never felt rushed here. Their cheesecake is YUMMY- they creme brulee the top for a crunch and smoky/caramel flavor and serve it with vanilla ice cream. I highly suggest their sparkling red wine if you like something sweeter; it's one of my fave wines! Their octopus was cooked well and the pastas are always well-seasoned. A little expensive (especially for the size) but I still enjoy my time there"

It’s quite a small place with a shared high table inside, seats at the bar and a number of covered tables outside. We sat inside at the shared table. There’s a nice calm and relaxing ambience inside. We originally intended to explore the Cichetti menu, but they had a great selection of specials including Octopus salad and Branzino which caught our attention. We ordered these along with crab and shrimp cake. Food was delicious, especially the Octopus salad. Service was friendly and attentive throughout. They have a nice selection of Italian wine to complement the food.  We really enjoyed our meal and evening and will definitely return on our next trip to NYC."

All were excellent and the restaurant had a very charming and cozy atmosphere. We really appreciated being able to find somewhere still taking orders and serving just after 11pm - our connecting flight out of JFK was canceled and we were unexpectedly in New York for the evening. Recommend and would return."

Feels like such a nice, cozy oasis/getaway in Hell’s Kitchen. I am that person that will always order the same thing, but had to try their latest special! Veal chop with mashed potatoes and asparagus in a mushroom sauce. YUMMMMM! Run don’t walk while it’s on the menu. Also always order the following starters: eggplant goat cheese, lamp chop lollipops, warm octopus salad.. actually just order everything on the appetizers menu. You won’t regret it!!!"

I originally found this restaurant on TikTok before traveling from the UK and pre-booked. We are at around 5pm and by 6 the outside seating was full with a lovely family friendly atmosphere. The menu was generous and greatly priced, with daily specials being offered for plenty of choice. The inside wine collection is also incredible."
