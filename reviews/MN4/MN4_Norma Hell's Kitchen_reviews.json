The pasta is incredible and every dish feels authentically made with care and tradition.\n\nDefinitely ask your waiter for recommendations and trust what they suggest - they know what’s best that day and every time we’ve taken their advice, it’s been spot on."

We ordered the Buffalo Ricotta with orange honey, meat stuffed rice ball, and Norma pizza with tomato, mozzarella, basil, eggplant, and ricotta. The Buffalo ricotta tasted sweet and could have been served as a dessert. The pizza dough had a flaky crust and the eggplant melted in your mouth which I really enjoyed. The rice ball was stuffed with meat and tasted savory but not too salty. Great restaurant to try before seeing a Broadway show."

When it was time to check the bill, there was that dish in it. Which I told you to take this dish out. But the waiter who took care of me that day was very bad manners.

Come primi gli anelletti al forno cotti nella teglia di terracotta (spaziali) e le busiate al pesto (molto buone).\nPer dolce abbiamo gustato con piacere il tiramisù, dolce molto equilibrato e i cannoli, la cialda veramente friabile e la ricotta delicata, gustosa ma non troppo dolce. Tutti i piatti sono fedeli alle ricette della tradizione e non hanno subito l’influenza americana. Aperitivi e vini di alta qualità. Perciò se desiderate mangiare cibo italiano (siciliano) questo ristorante è il posto perfetto!!\nFra l’altro ci sono altre sue sedi, una a Murray Hill e l’altra a Turtle Bay."

Food is always on point and I’ve tried different items on their menu. My drink to go is the Blood Orange Negroni. My favorite appetizer is the eggplant involtini and I highly suggest trying the gnocchi or pasta a la Norma. 😋  by the way this place is always busy and they do not take reservations. However, shoutout to the kind host (redhead) who always has a spot for me 🥹🫶"

I also had a lamb pasta, the red sauce added so much flavor and the el Dante is right on spot. I would come for food again but really it is way too loud for dinners… and maybe not good if you want to have conversations"

Feels very authentic and it attracted lots of Italian people.\n\nThe front of house hostess didnt make us wait long and the wait staff were very quick and attentive.\n\nFood was very delicious. The artichoke wasnt my favorite, seemed like it was missing something but the pizza was amazing. The cous cous dish was phenomenal!\n\nDrinks were very good.\n\nGreat place for a date or a night to talk with friends."

It had a nice atmosphere and the prices were very affordable for NYC standards.\n\nWe started with the arancini and potato cake. Both were very food; the aranicini was cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce for the potatoes was excellent.\n\nI tried two pasta dishes, and it the portion size was more than expected and the sauce complimented the pasta well. We got a pizza for the table that was loaded with fresh ingredients.\n\nA great spot for Italian"
