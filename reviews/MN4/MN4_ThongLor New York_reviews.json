Everything is very delicious and some people were even waiting outside because of how good the food is. There were also a lot of delivery orders we could see your people coming for takeout. I highly recommend you trying this place. It can get very busy around dinner time so come before then or a little bit after like around 7:30 p.m.."

I ordered the Khao Soi Moo Krob (pork belly thai curry noodles) and Kaeng Phed Ped Yang (crispy duck red curry).\n\nThe Khao Soi Moo Krob was so delicious, a perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and tangy. The pork belly stayed crispy in the broth.\n\nLoved the Kaeng Phed Ped Yang too. The bell peppers and pineapple kept the curry sweet and flavorful. The duck was nice and tender.\n\nThere are a lot of fancy/fusion thai restaurants in the city now, but ThongLor keeps the authenticity at an affordable price and adding a lot of unique dishes. Need to try more dishes!"

That said, as someone who enjoys more authentic Thai heat, I found the curry lacking the punch I was hoping for. The dish was still tasty, but I was left wanting deeper, more complex flavor notes.\n\nThe atmosphere is cheerful and inviting, with golden decor and traditional Thai music that help create a culturally immersive experience.\n\nThe staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive, adding to the overall warmth of the visit"

The place is small, but the flavors they offer pack a big punch.\n\nThe seafood pad Thai, kangkung, and shrimp eggplant dishes were all the rage. I enjoyed the crispness of the kangkung, the umami from the eggplant, and the tenderness of mussels and squid in their pad Thai. I can’t wait to come back and try some more of their delicious offerings.\n\nThe duck curry (I think this was a panang base) and the som tum was so flavorful and was packed with so much decadence. I really appreciated how ThongLor highlighted produce typically found in Thai cuisine, and didn’t skimp out on the bamboo shoot. They also added pineapple in their curry, which isn’t traditional of Thai cuisine but really added some acid to the dish which made it so balanced.\n\nWe had a bua loi for dessert and I’ll be honest, it wasn’t the best one I’ve had, but it still felt like a warm hug and a nice palate cleanser for the meal. I wish that the bua loi had more of a thicker coconut consistency, and that the taro balls weren’t as stuck together so it was easy to pick up. That being said, it was still a great end to our wonderful meal.\n\nWould I come back again? Absolutely. I highly recommend coming to this place with no more than 4 people. Seating is limited in the space so bring 3 of your closest friends and try everything on the menu."

The space is tight and they don’t take reservations, so it fills up fast — but that’s part of the experience. The servers were friendly and attentive, and the decor was cute and welcoming.\n\nWe started with the crispy golden bags, which were perfectly fried, light, and flavorful — a great appetizer.\n\nThe yellow curry was rich and comforting with just the right amount of spice, and the portion was generous.\n\nWe also tried a seafood dry suki, which was packed with flavor and had beautifully cooked seafood — definitely worth trying.\n\nI do wish the place was a little bigger, but honestly, the size adds to the charm. I feel lucky to have this spot in my neighborhood within walking distance. Definitely a go-to for solid Thai food in the city."

Also had a side of the yummy crab and lobster ravioli in spicy Thai sauce which had lemongrass flavors in an aromatic coconut milk broth. Lots of vegetarian and some vegan options. Good for adventurous kids too.  Large menu for such a small place The tiny dining room is adorned in tree branches with golden leaves giving it an exotic yet cozy air.

            "text": "They don't accept reservations but luckily, my friend and I met up early enough (6 pm on a Wednesday) and we got the last table. The restaurant is very small with maybe six tables inside and two outside. They have a drink menu but I don't think they have their alcohol license yet so I saw other people BYOB.\n\nWe decided to order a bunch of things to share:\n\n-Phla Kung (shrimp salad - chili paste, red onion, mint, lettuce in a spicy lime dressing) - we originally wanted to get the soft shell crab salad, but the waitress said it wasn't that good, which I appreciated. We really enjoyed the shrimp salad. The shrimp were big and perfectly cooked, and the lime dressing was so fragrant/flavorful/delicious\n-Khao Soi (egg noodles and chicken in a Thai curry broth) - the broth was good but the chicken was not. It had that old leftover chicken taste. You also have to eat the noodles pretty quickly, otherwise it becomes a soggy mess\n-Chicken larb - the flavors were good but the chicken again had this leftover taste. The spicy lime dressing from the shrimp salad helped make this dish a bit more palatable\n-Pad Thai with mixed seafood wrapped in egg - this was on the “Chef’s Specials” section of the menu, which I guess meant they put an egg on it and charged $25 on it. So not worth it. There was barely any seafood - just whatever is on top, which was three pieces of squid, two shrimp, and two mussels. The noodles itself were good so you're better off just ordering the regular Pad Thai. That'll save you $9\n\nI would probably come back just for the shrimp salad and maybe even the pad Thai. But just stay away from anything that has chicken in it."

Not having been to every Thai restaurant in NYC, I can still safely say that this is at the very least the best Thai experience in Hell's Kitchen. A must-try for any foodie!"

Everything was delicious!!! The drunken noodles were spicy but tasty spicy. That is a fine line to balance. 5/5 loved the vibes the food and the decoration! Super authentic :)"

We just kept saying \"mmmmmmmm\"\n\nUpdate: we went again on 15 September 2022. The service had a lot of issues. We waited for a very long time for our food to arrive. It trickled out and we finally decided to ask for the remainder to go. Great food but the operations need work. Reducing to 4 stars based on the service. Hopefully they'll figure it out."

I’ve traditionally had this dish with Chinese broccoli, but having it cooked in the delicious basil leaves added that much more flavor! Overall it was a great experience and I’ll be back!"
