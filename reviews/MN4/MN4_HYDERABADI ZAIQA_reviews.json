The gobi cauliflower was too saucy, bryinani too dry, lamb curry decent but all portions way too tiny--for both main dishes and sides.  There were steady stream of customers, but then again this is pretty much hells kitchen not far from theatre district and time square...\n\nThe venue is, even by NYC street food standard, a dump.  What you see in that picture is what you get.  A basement room with 3 tables.   I would've not come if not for my friend's insisting and infatuation."

Indian food stops being authentic when they start adding sugar to sauces in order to placate some imagined palates. The Malabar shrimp should be under desserts from the amount of sugar that was added to it. The sauce was sweet and otherwise tasteless. Frozen shrimp were thrown into a ready made sauce, unmarinaded, so zero taste to them. The chicken dum biryani was bland, just spiritless. Very disappointing overall. Don’t bother."

The samosas were on the better side of good, and the butter chicken (I’m lame, I know) was good but not great (shout out to Taj Grill in Buffalo for the best!). There’s only seating for a handful and so we shared a table with another pair, but that added to the charm actually. The wait staff were working their butts off on endless takeout orders but we’re kind and attentive if we needed anything, and it’s good to see such a small place being so busy. Very reasonable prices too. Hopefully they’ll be here still on our next trip."

The Chicken Tangri Kabab I received was pathetic, stale, and unfit for consumption — it felt like a leftover carelessly dispatched. The naan was cold and dry, completely lacking freshness. To make things worse, the mango lassi was sour and clearly stale, which raises serious concerns about food safety.\n\nThis wasn’t a one-off. During a previous order, I got what they called “Chicken 65 Biryani”, which was nothing more than some generic chilli chicken tossed with rice — a far cry from an authentic or even decent biryani.\n\nVery poor show, Hyderabad Zaika. I’ve revised my rating to 1 star. Food quality, hygiene, and authenticity need urgent attention."

Might not get the curry again because it is so fattening with all the coconut milk, or maybe I can just avoid eating all the coconut milk curry and only eat some of it plus the meat.\n\nThe chicken vepudu is good and interesting. I'm not sure if it comes without dairy by default or if you have to order it special with no dairy. It is a bit hot for me but if I take breaks between eating then it's not too hot. It comes with lightly fried batter, maybe lightly fried onions and other things, and the meat is tender. Would get again.\n\nThe lamb bhuna was delicious.

It was heavenly.\n\nHZ is one of the few Indian restaurants in the Tri-State area where I taste that same level of authenticity and flavor. The Hyderabadi Goongura Veg Dum Biryani is uncompromisingly savory and tart, driven by the fermented hibiscus paste that they layer throughout. The Mahi Fry Biryani features complex layers of spices, as does the Lamb Fry Biryani--and neither rely on the animal protein to provide flavor to the rice. Rather, the protein is complementary to the spice flavor profiles already encased in the rice.\n\nTheir other dishes are no losers either, from the wonderfully zesty HZ Special Chicken Lollipops, to the hearty Kadhai Subz, to the pungent Gobi 65. But the biryani is really the quarterback of the lot, and you should not leave without trying at least one.\n\nFinally, no more schlepping to Newark Ave in Jersey City!"

            "text": "This place used to be WARKOP, an Indonesian eatery selling indomie instant noodles that closed down early last year, but I have to say this is a well worth replacement because I think I finally found the best biryanis of my life… 🤯\n\nHad both the Hyderabadi Dum Goat biryani and the Dum Chicken biryani, both were very delicious but the goat one is significantly more fragrant! Truly couldn’t stop eating it!!\n\nEveryone talks about their Chicken Veppudu appetizer, which was indeed so great, but no one talks about the APOLLO FISH. Omg these were absolutely phenomenal, it’s similar to the 65 seasonings but even more refreshing.\n\nWill come back very soon but here’s everything I tried and really liked so far:\n- Gobi 65 (cauliflower)\n- Apollo Fish\n- Chicken Veppudu\n- Malabar Shrimp Curry (on the sweeter side, perfect with naan)\n- Garlic naan\n- Hyderabadi Goat Dum Biryani and the Chicken Dum Biryani\n\nService was pretty fast, and it was packed on a Tuesday night. Love love love."

This is a place where you go for the food only, not the ambience. The pictures on the wall are low resolution Jpgs blown up into poster size. It is loud and they can only seat about 16 people. Prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality of food. EDIT! They fixed the pictures on the wall and now they have little cardamon candy seeds at the end of the meal. Staff is really delightful. We've been back at least a dozen times."

Due to the limited seating, we shared a table with another couple, but the warm and welcoming ambiance made it comfortable. We ordered the goat biryani, mango lassi, and chicken vepudu. The service was quick, and all the dishes were packed with flavor (especially the biryani sauce!) and absolutely delicious. We left very satisfied :)"

We ordered the chicken biryani, hyderabadi goat biryani and the Malabari shrimp curry with rice. And OMG. Each dish was just out of the world!! To top it off, the prices are actually much more affordable compared to NYC standards.  Highly recommend and definitely coming back!❤️"
