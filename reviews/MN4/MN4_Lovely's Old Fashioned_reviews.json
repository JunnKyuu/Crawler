Das Fleisch war super saftig, das Brot perfekt getoastet und die Kombination mit den Pilzen einfach himmlisch. Man merkt, dass hier mit Leidenschaft gekocht wird. Der Besitzer war unglaublich freundlich und echt authentisch – so ein herzliches Gespräch hat man selten in einem Burgerladen. Wenn ich länger hier wäre, würde das definitiv mein Stammplatz für Burger werden. Klare Empfehlung!"

            "text": "Lovely’s Old Fashioned is hands-down one of the best burger spots in New York City — a true Hell’s Kitchen hidden gem that brings back that old-school diner charm with a modern twist. The moment you walk in, you smell the burgers sizzling on the grill and feel that cozy 1950s burger joint energy that’s hard to find anymore.\n\nThe burgers are everything you want: juicy, perfectly smashed, cooked to perfection, and served on a soft potato bun. I had the Charlotte’s Special, and it was unreal crispy fried onions, that signature sauce, and just the right amount of sweetness and tang. The sidewinder fries were golden, crisp, and addictive, and even the onion rings were top-tier. Everything here tastes like it was made with love and attention.\n\nService is friendly and fast you can tell the team cares about their food and the customers. The space is small but full of heart, with counter seating that lets you watch your burger being made right in front of you. It’s got that authentic New York burger shop feel that makes you want to come back again and again.\n\nPrices are fair (especially for NYC), portions are generous, and the quality speaks for itself. Whether you’re a burger lover, a foodie exploring Manhattan, or just someone looking for a great local spot near Times Square or Hell’s Kitchen, Lovely’s Old Fashioned is absolutely worth the stop.\n\nLovely’s delivers what every great NYC burger joint should: real ingredients, bold flavor, and good energy. This is easily one of the top burgers in New York City no gimmicks, just great food made the old-fashioned way."

The onion rings had a crispy, well-seasoned batter, and the fries were just the right amount of crispy. On taste alone, this place is easily a 5-star spot.\n\nHowever, my experience was tainted by the uncomfortable atmosphere created by one of the employees. An older Hispanic male, possibly Colombian, was openly berating his coworker, who was working hard on the grill. It was frustrating and upsetting to witness someone being micromanaged and constantly criticized, especially when they were clearly doing their best. The negative energy took away from the dining experience, making it hard to fully enjoy the meal.\n\nBecause of this, I’m giving it 3 stars. The food is excellent, but the staff dynamic needs serious improvement. Owner, please train your employees better and foster a more positive work environment—both for their sake and for your customers’ experience."

The burger had tons of flavor and the onion rings could be the best onion rings I ever had (cooked to perfection). I most definitely recommend you try this little burger joint out. There is also four to five diner style seating if you want to eat at Lovely’s."

Almost everything on the menu is excellent but here are some of my favorites:\n\n1) Double cheeseburger - get as is, no frills, just the basics done to perfection. Try and you'll see what I mean\n\n2l Charlotte's special - a good option if you want a single burger balanced with a heavy dose of grilled onion flavor.\n\n3) Patty melt - if you're craving something heavier and cheesier, different, a bit greasier\n\n4) Sides - both the fries and onion rings are a must try. Lovely's has their own great take.\n\n5) Hot dog - surprisingly good! An excellent hot dog if you're craving one"

The burgers were freshly smashed on the grill right in front of you and the buns were soft.\n\nWould recommend a double, as they are pretty small.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very small and has a handful of stools to eat at the counter."

It was a very solid dinner and as far as Manhattan prices go, it's not bad at all and one of the more affordable dinners we ate on our NYC trip. Overall, it was a pretty good experience."

Both of the guys we dealt with were super friendly and accommodating, the food is fairly priced and DELICIOUS. I’ve had the bacon cheeseburger, fries and hot dog and all three hit the mark. Everything was made to order, and an extra shoutout to the fries for being unique to any other fries I’ve had. This is just good old-fashioned food. No gimmicks, just great taste and service."
