I had tomatoes as a starter — very fresh and juicy — followed by carbonara, which was excellent. For dessert, I had tiramisu; the flavor was good, though the coffee taste was a bit too strong for me.\n\nThe waitresses were a bit too intense at times, but overall the service was fine.\n\nI recommend it!"

We had the rigatoni alla vodka and the special: a lamb ragu pappardelle, both of which were amazing and great portion sizes and a solid price. The service was fantastic, especially given we were celebrating a birthday, but even on normal days everyone is extremely friendly and attentive, and in general service is fast. I'd highly recommend the rigatoni alla vodka, spaghetti carbonara, taglierini negro, or the rigatoni alla norma, as these 4 dishes are our personal favorites. Definitely give this place a visit, you won't regret it!"

Reservations were easily made via Open Tables. My partner, our friends and I were greeted warmly by the staff upon arrival at Bocca di Bacco and led to a table for 9 in the back, whose interior is quite dark and the AC could have been a bit stronger. Not the deepest menu, but some solid options with enough for even a picky eater to find something they will want. We decided on the Cheeseburger, Omelet, Classic Benedict, Avocado Benedict, Fried Chicken & Belgian Waffles, Side of Bacon, and Side of Sausage from the weekend brunch. A basket full of petite muffins started our meal. Everything was perfectly prepared with fresh ingredients and brought out at the same time. All throughout our meal, we never felt rushed nor had to ask for extra water; it was always brought promptly by the staff. They were accommodating, and our server was Mynor. The portions were reasonable. Price-wise, it wasn’t cheap but was worth it. We continue to recommend this place.\n————————-\nLocated near Columbus Circle and Central Park in Hell’s Kitchen, this establishment is owned by brothers Enrico and Robert in collaboration with chef Kristen Sollenne. With three locations down 9th Avenue, it is a favorite spot for celebrities, tourists, and native New Yorkers alike. On the surface, Bocca di Bacco, translated “mouth of the wine god,” doesn’t look much different than any of those places. However, they are known for their exquisite Italian fare, intimate ambiance, incomparable hospitality, and robust wine selection. Reservation was easily made via Open Table around 12:15pm for Sunday lunch. So, my partner, our friends and I were seated right away as first-timers at this very tastefully decorated, cozy, and modern vibe where the tables were closed together. The interior is quite dark; one gets used to it after a while unless you opt for a table close to the front, which we did. Their menu was an extensive offering of small plates, fresh pastas, and tasty full-sized entrees with some vegetarian options. We decided on brunch and ordered Avocado Benedict, Fried Chicken and Belgian Waffles, Frittata Primavera, Rigatoni alla Vodka, and side of Truffle Fries. A basket full of petite muffins started our meal. The food was very fresh and well seasoned. The portions were perfect. It didn't put too much hurt on the wallet. The service was very good, not rushed, and our server was Carlos. One doesn’t have to go to Little Italy for a homemade pasta meal, and we can recommend this place."

I had the pleasure of meeting Christina recently and was immediately struck by how warm and engaging she is. She has this easy charm that makes you feel instantly comfortable, and she carries herself with the kind of confidence and attentiveness that’s rare to find. She's the kind of person who makes conversation feel effortless, genuine, friendly, and always tuned in to the energy of the room. It’s clear she’d make an incredible server. Not just because of her personality, but because she knows how to read people and respond in a way that feels personal and thoughtful. Any restaurant would be lucky to have her on the floor."

We were the first diners but as more people arrived they were all seated right around us which was odd, as there was so much space. I don't mind hearing others conversations but they were so loud and so close it just ruined what was a really nice ambience. That aside, the food was good without being excellent. Starters were huge and a main meal in themselves. There must have been 20 Calamari and  6 large meatballs as an example. No complaints from me there! The main meals needed more flavour as it was a little on the bland side. The Lasagne and Carbonara were OK, but definitely had better, so a little disappointed. The pizza was probably the best meal of the group. Cost was $250 which included a $50 bottle of wine. Overall it was good but not one I would book again."

The Rigatoni vodka is also really good and drinks are amazing too. The inside is lively on a Saturday night. It did take us a while to get our food since it was pretty busy. Keep in mind if you have a reservation, they will only seat you if your whole party is present!"

Attentive, professional, and warm, he made the entire experience feel elevated from start to finish. It's rare to come across someone who genuinely enhances your dining experience the way he did. Top-of-the-line service that deserves to be recognized. Highly recommend this spot—and if you get Salvatore, you're in for a treat!"

The lamb chops was seasoned well and the pasta carbonara, I couldn’t get enough. The table side tiramisu was beautifully presented and very unique to other tiramisu I had in the past. Great spot for birthday, date night and/group get together."

Also the music is pretty loud so it makes it hard to hear what someone is saying even from across the table. I got my order wrong simply because it was too loud for my server to hear my order. The food for my meal was still good. I also ordered the espresso martini and the Verry Berry. Both were vodka based but be wary of the Very Berry. I couldn’t taste the alcohol so I didn’t notice the impact until I stood up."

If you need a good quick Italian meal without thinking too much about it: go here. It’s good across the board, but don’t come expecting fine dining or a standout meal. More of a place to have a meal while focusing on catching up with friends and family"

Giovanni was a complete gentleman and he was so fun to speak with. Eduardo was great in making sure that my sister and I were okay. The food and drinks were high quality and nothing was left on the table. I’m definitely coming here again to have brunch."

Portions are on the larger size which was great but we left stuffed. We started with the Mediterranean salad which was fresh and very tasty. My husband got the steak and frites. Steak was cooked perfect and had good flavor. The fries were unexpectedly delicious.  Crisp but not fried out and just the right amount of salt. I got the chicken Parmigiano. Very good. Everything you would want and expect. Delicious and huge serving. We also got a 1/2 order of the cacio e pepe. So good!! We left very full and very satisfied.  Thank you!"

We ordered some appetizers: calamari (which as fine), arancini ball, and bread.  It may have been an office evening at the bar, but the few items we had were ok.  I think we will need to visit another time and have a complete dinner experience"
