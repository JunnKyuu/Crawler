I had the french toast with berries and whipped marscapone. The marscapone was very good as was the french toast. All the portions were a little small though for the price and my appetite the day after the marathon."

The service was good, the lady came up to me at all the right moments as if she knew I needed something. As you can see, I think you can agree the presentation of the food is very aesthetic. The shakshuka was a bit strong on the spices for my taste but I think I would come back for the whipped ricotta with figs and iced chai latte. Although pricy, they make it really good 😊"

Birthdays, anniversary, Valentine’s Day, just because— you name it. The last time I came here, which was over a year ago by the way, was a complete letdown. The difference between these photos are night and day. The portion size reduction paired with the price increase is ridiculously disappointing. I have no problem paying for an experience when it is actually worth the price. Your new customers may not notice but trust your long time customers definitely do."

She was trying to stack that one dollar on my croissant order.\nI did't even begin in rage until -  she was not trying to explain, but she kept saying it is just one dollar and made it like my fault and asked your help.\n\nIt is your fault that your online system did not reflect the real charge. And I don't appreciate the invisible expense. My rage is not from nowhere. Please be more respectful to your customer and be more willing to admit you mistake going forward.\n\nI acknowledge that they refunded me as of now.\n\n----------------------------\nI ordered online and I was going to pick up my order.\n\nNothing happened / explained until I was saying I am going to order a croissant as well.\n\nThe lady at the counter added 1dollar for the toast fee. They were referring to this toast fee for my online order.\n\nAs I pointed out, she started to explain this toast actually has 1 dollar charge, which was not reflected on their online system.\n\nI refused to pay as it is separate order. In my order at the counter, it only has a croissant.\n\nThey refused to give me order now and the counter lady called the manager.\nThe manager offered a refund to my online order.\n\nI haven’t received the refund yet and was not able to get my food.\n\nNo one was admitting the mistake and kept telling me the toast is only one dollar.\n\nI found this experience ridiculous."

            "text": "We had the Shakshuka and the breakfast sandwich; both were absolutely perfect! The place is quite small, with limited seating, but the service is fast, so I don’t think the wait would ever be too long. My husband had the Chai latte , a bit too sweet for my taste, but still very well made. A special mention goes to the Americano, which was honestly exceptional; one of the best I’ve ever had! Highly recommend it for a great breakfast or brunch.\n\nThe only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I came back on a Tuesday around 2 PM (they close at 3 PM), the café was almost empty and I just wanted to have another Americano coffee; my husband was also going to order a drink. However, we were told that we could only sit if we ordered food. Even though the place wasn’t half full, we couldn’t stay just for coffee. It doesn’t change how great the food and service are, but it was a bit disappointing. 😮"

We didn’t mind it, but it’s definitely not for everyone.\n\nBonus points for the attentive manager making regular rounds with water and check-ins — a small gesture that added to the experience.\n\nWe’ll definitely be back.

            "text": "As you can see from the photos, this was the thinnest (and most expensive) yogurt bowl I’ve ever had in NYC. For $18, the yogurt layer wasn’t even 1 cm thick. The granola wasn’t homemade either. It was from Purely Elizabeth’s Granola, which I recognized immediately since I eat it almost every day. Definitely not worth the price.\n\nThe service was extremely disappointing. Servers greeted every table around us with smiles and check-ins, but completely skipped ours. One server set the plates down very harshly, and another tried to remove an empty plate almost as soon as it was placed. It felt very uncoordinated and unfriendly.\n\nOn top of that, the music was so loud we couldn’t hear each other, and the tables were so small that we had to put our water cups on the floor just to fit the food.\n\nOverall, a very disappointing experience. I would not recommend this place."

We loved the menu so much that we ended up coming back three times during our NYC stay. We tried the avocado toast, shakshuka, ricotta toast, yogurt bowl, and French toast. The star of the show? Definitely the French toast—easily the best I’ve ever had. Perfectly crunchy and caramelized on the outside, soft on the inside, and served with fresh berries. A must-try!"

Thank you for a great experience - particularly Mariana. 🙏🙏😊"

To me, that policy seems quite outdated!\n\nAlso the food was mid!!!"

            "text": "I recently visited In Common NYC and found the experience to be a mix of positives and negatives. On the positive side, the service and staff were attentive and pleasant, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. The coffee program is excellent, our latte, mocha, and chai were all outstanding.\n\nHowever, the food fell far short of expectations. My brisket sandwich ($19.50) featured well-seasoned meat but was so tough it was nearly impossible to bite or tear, forcing me to eat it with a knife and fork and separate the components. The sandwich came on inexpensive potato buns more akin to generic grocery store hamburger buns than what you’d expect at this price point.\n\nMy spouse ordered the berries and cream ($13), which arrived as just a few slices of strawberries and some raspberries — a surprisingly sparse presentation next to a generous serving of the delicious cream. Our third guest had the breakfast sandwich ($15), which was decent but again served on the same low-quality buns with no sides.\n\nWhile the drinks were a highlight, the food quality and presentation did not justify the high prices, even for NYC standards. This is an establishment with a good vibe, friendly staff, and potential, but the kitchen and menu execution need serious attention. Unfortunately, based on this experience, I won’t be recommending this to others."
