            "text": "Despite the good reviews the food was mediocre. Not bad. But not special in any way. The birria taco was really disappointing. I’ve had the most amazing birria stew in Puerto Rico and I’ve had a phenomenal one in Rochester (shout out to Tavos!). The beef was a bit dry and bland not tender enough and deeply marinated. Even the consume with it was flavorless and greasy. The empanada was more like a corn dog texture not the flakey but dense corn shell you would expect. The inside was flavorless. The pork and pineapple was similarly flavorless save for the few pineapple spears in the taco despite being (supposedly) marinated pork. The fish taco was better than the birria and the fish was cooked nicely but not overly flavorful. The salsa and chips were really good. Too bad the rest of the food wasn’t as good as the salsa! The yuzu mocktail was amazing!  The margarita was average (shout out to Lloyd in Buffalo for a stellar margarita). We liked the unpretentious decor that also didn’t go for the faux Mexican aesthetic that is everywhere else. It was calm, chill, and reminded me more of the local decor in the restaurants I went to in Puerto Rico where no one was trying to put on a show for the customers. The vibe and setting was the highlight of the meal."

            "text": "El Coco – Hell’s Kitchen\n📍 Review by @justinmateonyc\n\nIf you're looking for a vibrant, flavor-packed escape in the heart of Hell’s Kitchen, El Coco absolutely delivers—starting with the CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE. Served with housemade chips that are perfectly crisp with just the right touch of salt, this starter sets the tone for everything to come. The guac is creamy, fresh, and full of limey zing, a classic done right.\n\nNow let’s talk AL PASTOR—marinated pork with sweet pineapple that hits that perfect balance of savory and juicy. But the real surprise? That pineapple chutney. It’s next level. Sweet, tangy, and a little spicy—it brought the whole dish together in the best way.\n\nI went with the cheeseburger empanadas (yes, you read that right), and they were unreal—crispy on the outside, ooey-gooey savory on the inside. My fiancée had the jalapeño empanadas and shrimp & crab meat camarones tacos, both of which were fresh, flavorful, and had that signature El Coco twist: bold, layered flavor and beautifully presented.\n\nThe vibe here is unmatched—El Coco is popped out in pink, fun, and full of personality. It’s got that Instagram-ready aesthetic but without sacrificing authenticity or comfort. The energy in the room is as vibrant as the food.\n\nShoutout to Denise, our server, who was warm, welcoming, and super attentive—made us feel right at home.\n\nAs a food photographer and content creator, El Coco is exactly the kind of place I love discovering. The colors, the plating, the ambiance—all photogenic and all delicious. Definitely a spot that makes my food trips across NYC worth it.\n\n📸 Follow my food adventures at @justinmateonyc\n#FoodieFinds #HellsKitchenEats #ElCocoNYC"

Overall, it was a good experience but not a great one.\n\nMy biggest issue was the fourteen dollar order of chips and cheese. We ran out of chips well before we ran out of dip. Our server asked if we wanted more chips, and we said sure. Then they charged us two dollars for the extra chips. That felt a bit ridiculous, especially considering the price of the appetizer and how inexpensive chips actually are.\n\nIt’s more about the principle for me. The server didn’t mention there would be an extra charge. I would have questioned it right away. It just felt like a weird move. Most Mexican restaurants give you chips for free when you sit down."

            "text": "[Edit] Couldn’t find the weekend tip policy on their website. Is this even real? I just reviewed their menu online and see that the table limit is listed as 90 minutes, right at the top of the menu. But nothing about the required 20% tip on weekend service. Knocking down to two stars, I feel disrespected as a diner for not being properly informed about this anywhere in advance and made to feel like my server might be cheating me when he selected the 20% tip button without consulting us. Not mad about paying 20% tip, mad about being treated this way.\n\n[Edit 2] And honestly the service wasn’t stellar. Server rarely stopped by the table, and I had wanted to order more drinks. Oh, and he didn’t even offer us a receipt until we asked for one. Ok, down to one star.\n\nEl Coco needs to make it clear up front that the server will tap the 20% tip button for you on the checkout machine because there is an automatic 20% applied for service on weekends. I was very upset to see my server select “20%” on the checkout machine for himself, and our table honestly thought he was being dishonest. After talking it out with him, he explained that this is restaurant policy on the weekends. I would have been fine with this policy if I had known up front — people need a living wage — but this left a bad taste in my mouth. We double checked with another server, who said the same thing.\n\nWill confirm that the frozen margarita and piña colada were pretty dang great, and I liked the low $5 price; a good bargain.\n\nMy birria taco was good; the other food was so so.\n\nI liked the visual vibes; I didn’t like that it was so noisy. I could kind of talk but often had to ask people to repeat themselves."

Let's start with the positives.\n\nPros:\n-Quesadilla was great! The cheese pull was very satisfying and the meat quality for the steak was really really good. Taste-wise, that won me over. I'd go again just for that.\n\n-The margaritas were dangerous. They don't taste strong but they will creep up on you.\n\nOpportunities:\n-Even though the quesadilla was delicious, they serve it whole and not cut. It doesn't affect the flavor, just inconvenient to eat.\n\n-The margaritas were so small in size. The happy hour price seems good but when the drink comes to you, the size will definitely shock you. This is a personal thing for me but they were pre-batched.\n\n-The birria taco was lacking some flavor especially in the consumé.\n\nMy favorite part of most restaurants/bars is the bartender/server. Great service will always improve an eating experience.\n\nI want to check out the location in Hells Kitchen to see if I will like it better. This place has potential to get better."

The service was truly outstanding—attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable without being pretentious. The staff seemed genuinely passionate about the menu and made thoughtful recommendations based on our preferences. Our server was especially remarkable, checking in at the right times and ensuring our glasses were never empty. It’s rare to feel so well taken care of without the experience feeling forced or overly formal.\n\nNow, onto the food—absolutely phenomenal. Each dish was beautifully presented, full of flavor, and clearly made with high-quality, fresh ingredients. We started with a selection of appetizers that showcased a creative blend of textures and tastes. The main courses were equally impressive; the meat was cooked to perfection, the sauces were rich and well-balanced, and the vegetarian options were anything but boring. Every bite felt like a culinary adventure. Even the dessert managed to exceed expectations—decadent without being overly sweet, and plated like a work of art.\n\nThe ambience of the place deserves just as much praise. The interior design struck the perfect balance between cozy and sophisticated, with soft lighting, tasteful decor, and a well-curated playlist that added to the relaxed atmosphere. Whether you’re looking for an intimate date night or a comfortable dinner with friends, the setting adapts beautifully. The layout allowed for enough privacy while still feeling part of the overall energy of the place.\n\nIn conclusion, this restaurant offers the kind of complete experience that leaves a lasting impression. From top-tier service and exquisite cuisine to a welcoming and stylish environment, every detail is thoughtfully executed. I wouldn’t hesitate to return and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly memorable dining experience."

Unfortunately, the service we received was extremely unprofessional. I should not have had to repeatedly go to the bar to request drink refills while the servers stood around socializing or appeared to be having their own meeting at the bar. At one point, my friend and I witnessed them flipping a coin to determine who would take the next table. That alone speaks volumes.\n\nIf gratuity had not already been included, they would have received no tip from me. And frankly, this highlights the downside of automatic gratuity—regardless of party size, excellent service should be a given. In fact, considering we were a large group on a Thursday, in the rain, making up the majority of their business that evening, I would have expected even more attentiveness.\n\nOn a positive note, I did appreciate the $6 happy hour offered all day. I chose this location because I had a great experience here in 2023, which made this visit even more disappointing. I would consider returning to another location, but I won’t be returning to this one."

            "text": "Service was super friendly. Food and drinks were decent, although drink sizes are pretty tiny and the margarita was pretty weak; the ambience and music were great but super loud, you can’t really hear anyone at your table talking. Also worth noting I did not see anywhere on the menu nor did the server mention at all that 20% gratuity to my party was automatically applied, so I am realizing now I accidentally tipped twice because it asked for a tip again when she ran my card at the table. This should be stated more clearly so that this can be avoided and people don’t pay double what they mean to."

I could barely understand anyone at my table, let alone communicating with the servers. Ordered a frozen margarita, was brought a regular margarita, charged an extra dollar for the frozen. Food is mediocre. Wish I had known it was trying to be a club scene before I based all my dinner plans around it."

He was very attentive and kept ensuring that we were ok.\n\nI was disappointed in the size of the “happy hour” drinks but I guess you shouldn’t expect much for $5. The drinks were delicious but just misleading due to the size.\n\nWe also had the elote and spinach and cheese empanada which was delicious."

            "text": "Not once did our server come to check on us. A man with curly hair & glasses. Had to flag him down each time, awkwardly. When we did get his attention, politely. He would say “yeah yeah of course.” Then blatantly disregard us & carry on conversing with his friend or irrelevant tasks he could perform when it’s not busy (it wasn’t.)\n\nThere was a dead fly in our cup, disgusting. We had to remind him we needed a new drink after he just brought us a new cup? We ordered chips & salsa & fajitas, he brought out the chips a minute before our entree. That’s not usually how appetizers work. Our salsa was hot from sitting so long. Mind you he’s doing nothing, I believe I saw him breaking down boxes? While the bartender, a pleasant woman, seemed to be over exerting herself doing her job & what appeared to be his as well.\n\nNo refills were offered to us, it’s 90 degrees outside. My 6 year old son begging us for water, however getting this servers attention made us feel like we’re the ugly kids at the end of the lunch-table. The bartender ironically was the one who asked us how the service was. Not our server. We were constantly flagging this man in glasses down to ask politely for more chips, more tortillas for our fajitas, drinks; Had to vocally yell for our check, after I myself, then my wife tried to get his attention because he was too busy conversing with I’m assuming a friend of his at the bar eating Popeyes.\n\nHe knew what he was doing.\n\nExtremely unprofessional. Borderline intentional judging by other reviews regarding this same Individual with glasses. I dare say bigoted.\n\nThe fajitas were clearly microwaved, the drinks come in 4 ounce cups. Not how I’d like to spend my Sunday. Don’t come here."

But was not pushy at all, normally I do encounter lots of pushy waiters especially when they realize how I’m intentionally taking pictures of the restaurant and service so I can write my reviews. As I believe and stand by creating true and honest reviews. And WOW they get no credit. YOU HAVE TO COME HERE ONCE. $5 drinks, $4 tacos and $3 empanadas. Drinks where very tasty but full of ice. Tacos where great but very salty. And the empeñadas where fresh but very bland. But for those prices, honestly I can’t argue. I would come back multiple times here to bring friends and all. And the service here is amazing. I will be back ❤️"

Very affordable and comes with different stuff like rice, beans, chicken, chips, cheese and a side of sour cream. Nachos were ok. I would definitely be coming back for the bowl.

What was supposed to be a catch up meal with friends turned into a shouting match and eventually we just gave up being able to communicate. The food was OK. Chicken enchiladas - the sauce was decent. The chicken was really inedible. For $22 I was pretty upset at how bad the enchiladas were. My wife's meal was OK. Our friends meals were very dry. Seems like they use toppings to cover up for bland dried out meat. Drinks were super tiny. All in it was not a great experience."
