The place was empty at lunchtime (as it usually seems to be), and now I understand why. When our food came out, my partner’s $27 dish was literally frozen - not just cold or lukewarm, but still iced solid in the center.\n\nWe told the waiter, and his only response was “ok” before picking up the plate to take it back to the kitchen to “reheat” it. That was enough for us, we didn’t stay to find out what would happen next and just left.\n\nFor a $27 plate, serving something frozen is completely unacceptable. I really wanted to like this place since it’s in the neighborhood, but after that experience, we won’t be back."

My salad was overdressed, the “garlic” bread had just butter and cost $11.95 when they charged me without notification for Parmesan that I wanted since I can’t stand lathered mozzarella on crunchy garlic bread and it was just the powdered Kraft kind not even the real shaved. I was having a migraine so I couldn’t stand hearing some of the music that had “suicidal” playing. At least it was good service. But the prices are ludicrous"

Unfortunately, it fell short in just about every area except service.\n\nI spent $28 on what felt like a very thrown together plate. I’ve had $10 pasta from casual spots that tasted way more intentional. The pasta was just okay..not overcooked, but definitely underwhelming. The meatballs themselves were a bit spicy, which I usually love, but here it was more like bland heat. No depth, no real flavor payoff. It was missing seasoning, herbs, sauce richness just vibes and heat.\n\nThe restaurant was completely empty when I went, which was surprising given the hype. That alone made the atmosphere feel a little off. On the bright side, the bartender was super sweet and attentive, which honestly was the highlight of the experience. Props to them.\n\nOverall, the food didn’t match the price, the flavor didn’t match the expectations, and the hype definitely didn’t translate in real life. Might be a better spot for drinks or apps if you’re already nearby, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for it again."

He continually checked on us and asked us if he needed anything. It took about 5 minutes before he took drinks and food. The OG was very good and it came with a Caesar salad that was delicious. I would not recommend the rigatoni with pesto unless you're getting it. As aside. It is very filling. Also, the tables were very sticky. Overall, I would recommend this if you need a quick place to eat."

I asked if they could do mine with a little less OJ (because hello, I came for the bubbles, not a Vitamin C overdose), but the waiter very sweetly told me they follow a strict measurement and couldn’t possibly adjust it. I was like, “No worries!”—but then my next mimosa came out even juicier than the first. Like, was the prosecco even invited to the party?\n\nI get having a policy, but if your mimosas are 90% orange juice and 10% regret, maybe rethink the ratio—especially when so many other spots are way more generous with the bubbly.\n\nFood was solid, service was kind, but if you're brunching for the buzz... you might leave more hydrated than tipsy."

We ordered the carafe of Chianti for $19 which I HIGHLY recommend, it was very high quality. My mom ordered the chicken pesto cavatappi which was delicious. There were at least 6-7 meatballs in it and the cheese was delicious. I ordered the kitchen sink which comes with your choice of meatballs and sauce with sides the chef picked. I will say, I was expecting the sides to be hot and they were cold but they were still really good. The side salad had a nice flavor, the carrots were caramelized and the broccoli had nice seasoning. Our waiter, Hunter, was also very good and checked on us often. His attitude was just so positive that it really rounded out the night. I would definitely come here again and recommend that you do as well!"
