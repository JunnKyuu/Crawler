I would recommend anyone in NY or that is visiting, to come on by; your tummies are waiting to be satisfied ☺️"

When I called to raise my concern, I was asked to send a video to the manager, which I did, but unfortunately I never received a response or resolution.

            "text": "Really hyped, and with a lot of reviews, the expectations were high.\n\nWhat was good?\nWhen for starters the chicken was indeed quite good. But in the context of other Peruvian chicken I’ve had in the past, it was not extraordinary. Yes the skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. The arroz chaufa hit all the savory notes that I was looking for too. The sangria didn’t disappoint either.\n\nWhat was bad?\nOverall, not too much other than the sporadic and slightly chaotic service. Not necessarily any marks against Pio Pio for this, I think it was just a busy night.\n\nThe main issue I had was the frozen chicken used in the arroz chaufa. In a restaurant that is known for its chicken, you wouldn’t think they would cheap out on it at any point. But, this was simply not the case. It was dry, chewy, and clearly not as fresh as their rotisserie chicken.\n\nIt didn’t scare me off entirely from going back, but I was disappointed to say the least. Most people have extremely low bars for chicken as a meat they would spend money on at a restaurant. Don’t give people a reason to complain I just don’t get it. Looking back on it, I would have said something or sent the dish back, not because I’m an asshole, but because I know they can do better."

Me gaste 100 dolares por algo que no valio nada la pena. El lomo saltado estuvo muy seco, el arroz se salvo. La causa ni sabia a causa, fue muy pastosa y seca tambien. Los anticuchos no sé qué sazón tenian pero peruano no era. Siento que la comida peruana sea ahora tan cara y sea dificil encontrar un buen lugar. No recomendio a nadie comer ahí, y no lo digo porque sea malo, sino porque como consumidor, nadie merece comer comida seca y mala llevandose asi una mala experiencia de la comida peruana.

First time the limo saltado was medium done and so juicy, unfortunately the second time it wasn’t as good. The arroz con mariscos was super good as usual, that plate is good enough for 2 people so be mindful."

The sauce goes so well with the rice! The serving size was so big,  wish we didn’t order the appetizer. The chicha morada (sweet purple corn beverage) is a must have."

Just want people to know that my reviews are unbiased and based on my actual food tastes experience. Some of the dishes were good. The popular rotisserie chicken was somewhat dry and salty. Sweet plantain appetizer wasn't as sweet as expected. Overall, some of the dishes were satisfying. The service was great! And the waiter advised us that the total bill already included 20% tips for a large party group.👍"

            "text": "Pio Pio 8, a Peruvian restaurant located in the heart of Manhattan, has always been one of my favorite spots for its authentic and delicious cuisine. The ceviche is fresh and flavorful.\n\nHowever, my recent visit left much to be desired in terms of service quality. From the moment I arrived, the staff seemed eager to rush me through the dining experience. They hurried me to place my order and later pressed me to settle the bill quickly. This created an uncomfortable atmosphere, making me feel like I was an inconvenience rather than a valued customer. Despite arriving late, I expected the same level of courtesy and attentiveness that other patrons received.\n\nAdditionally, the restroom was quite uncomfortable and lacked a mirror, which added to the overall negative experience. It's crucial for a restaurant to balance efficiency with hospitality, ensuring that all customers feel welcome and valued, regardless of their arrival time. I hope Pio Pio 8 can address these service issues, as it has the potential to provide an exceptional dining experience consistently."
