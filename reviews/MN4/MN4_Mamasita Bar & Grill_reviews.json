But there are definitely fishy reviews here, its not 4.7 star restaurant by anyones interpretation, as many other reviewers have pointed out.\n\nThe food is mid 2 star (at best). Takes quite a long time to bring the food, and it leaves alot to be desired. Far better mexican in nyc. If this place was true 4.7 star it would be packed, and it isnt. The guac says fresh on the menu, but it looked and tasted like store bought and was not freshly made. Portions were small for the price.\n\nThe service was fine. Vibe was ok. They charge 4% for credit card which is rich, especially taking into account the already expensive prices for the quality of food.\n\nIts not bad, but i was expecting MUCH MORE based on the rating. 2 star food. 4 star drinks. 3 star prices. Would not recommend and won't be returning."

We were even offered free dessert, but we were stuffed and had to pass.

After the owner found out my husband and I just got married, he sent us a delicious tres leches cake on the house. Overall, I was so happy we chose to come here for dinner and can’t wait to be back!"

Worth trying again. We started with the queso, which was different than others I’ve had in the past. Less cheesy and included beans. Recommended! We ate the Tex Mex burrito, some enchiladas, and the chicken enchiladas with brown mole sauce. I would have liked more sauce on/in my burrito. The filling was tasty cooked perfectly.\n\nLocal find in a part of town that’s more and more overrun with new places."

However, typically, other patrons are understandable and helpful with letting others by.\n\nThe drinks are AMAZING. We opted for the smaller sizes because we wanted to sample different flavors, so we did 3 margaritas each. Let me just say that the margaritas were poured with a heavy hand and were greatly appreciated. I made it home from the restaurant to the Northeast section of the BX and was still feeling my buzz heavily. So, yes, the drinks are worth the hype and price.\n\nThe food was good and tasty, but I was a bit disappointed with the portion sizes. However, it's important to note that I wasn't still starving after eating, but for the prices, I expected a little more.\n\nOverall, my only downfall is that we hadn't visited this place sooner. I for sure know we will definitely be returning soon."

Beware: the glowing reviews here seem fake — possibly generated through a review app.\n\nI came for lunch and ordered a burrito and a drink. My total, with tax, was $39. They then added $7.50 as “gratuity,” plus another $3 charge with no explanation. Final bill? $49 — nearly a 40% tip. To make it worse, they crossed out the tip section as if I did it — I did not.\n\nAnd the food? Disgusting. I was starving and still couldn’t finish it. I regret not speaking up sooner, but hopefully this helps someone else avoid the same mistake.\n\nThe business responded to me and said I exaggerated by saying they took it upon themselves to add a 40% tip, even though I posted the receipts and it CLEARLY SHOWS WHAT WAS DONE. THEY TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO ADD A 10 dollar tip as you can see my bill with tax was 39 dollars and I walked out paying 49… Again please beware. And you can always report them to the better business bureau for stealing!"

Food was delicious and I left feeling delightfully full. I got the authentic chicken platter with garlic sauce (recommended by PK) and it was mouthwatering. I was also pleased to find out the chicken was organic. Will definitely come back again when I’m in the area. Thank you, Mamasita!"

On the chicken fajitas I did enjoy that it was grilled just right without it being dry but the seasoning was not there. The chicken enchiladas were decent no complaints there. The guac for my personal taste was too chunky and no flavor. Overall I would say with so many Mexican options in Manhattan alone I would personally pass on this one."

The vibe is super chill and fun, and the food is awesome. We'll start with the chips and salsa - this salsa is one of the best we have had, perfectly spiced and nice and onion-y and the chips are very fresh. The chicken fajitas are awesome as well. Oh and the margaritas are huge and delicious. Go!"

            "text": "I heard about this place through a post on Instagram. I was expecting a larger sized restaurant, but it turned out to be a nice little hole in the wall kind of joint. I went on a Sunday afternoon without a reservation, and I was able to get a table immediately. The young lady who waited on me from behind the bar was very friendly, and she could serve up a great Pina Margarita. It was so good that I got two. The service getting my food order was a tad slow, but once I was served, everything tasted great. I ordered the jalapeno poppers and the pescado veracruz, and both had great flavors. Even though the rice and beans that came with my entree looked plain, it tasted good as well. I also got complementary chips and salsa for the table. They have a pretty extensive food and drinks menu with different flavored margaritas, and everything is reasonably priced. The restaurant is kept pretty clean, and all tables are wiped down after patrons leave. I enjoyed my first dining experience here, and I will stop in again the next time I pass through the area."
