He just delivered the food to the table and never, never come back to check on us, no one time, We wanted more coffee but he never offer us more,  the food was good, is always good every single time we go there, but the service is very important also; we asked the check to 4 different people ( I am not even kidding), I do not know if this guy was the owner or the owner's son, or the manager, but his attitude was the worse, making us feel like we were bothering, We like to eat in this dinner  when we go to the city but I will not stay and eat in this place  if the server is this guy again, I rather to go somewhere else. He told us his name is.''Pancho\" , but the check said that his name is ALVARO."

New York is a fast paced city where people don't normally have time for tourists - it can feel unfriendly at times. But coming here was like coming home. The warm greeting from Jeff at the door, was akin to putting cold hands near a warm fire - instantly soothing and pleasant. The service came with a smile, with friendliness, we didn't feel rushed, nothing was too much. Coffee was refilled, food was delicious and plentiful amd prices very reasonable. This will be my first stop rather than my last stop next time I visit NYC. We had pancakes with banana, Nutella, bacon and syrup which were delicious. We were especially impressed by the fluffiness of the pancakes. We'll be dreaming of this breakfast until next time!"

It was served with a salad and bread basket. I also ordered chicken noodle soup that tasted homemade. We usually don’t order desserts but the dessert counter looked incredible. We ordered German chocolate cake with ice cream. Delicious is an understatement! It was perfection!!\nEvery staff member was friendly, welcoming and respectful. My biggest complaint?\nI was in New York for five days and on my last day we found this incredible diner. I can honestly say I can’t believe there are not lines down the street waiting for this place.\nThe restaurant was CLEAN, the rest rooms were Immaculately taken care of.

Food arrived hot and fresh. The American style pancakes were soft and not stodgy at all. The bacon was crispy and the syrup was warm and gooey.\n\nThe french toast was well cooked with a light dosing of icing sugar and just the right level of cinnamon.

All the food was delicious and the staff was friendly.\n\nWe were lucky and arrived and were seated right away but there was a big line right after us.\n\nWe had lox and bagel which was great...capers, cream cheese, onion and salmon with a fresh roasted bagel.cPancakes and sausage and more \"American\" breakfast food. The pork sausage was better than the turkey. Fluffy and perfectly prepared eggs.\n\nThe menu is huge so options for everyone."

On a tenté « par erreur malencontreuse » de me facturer deux fois le même plat. Faites donc attention à vos reçus avant de payer !"

I love eating at Diners, and Westway did not disappoint.  It was very clean, the service was decent, the staff was polite, and the food was delicious.  They have a very big menue with lots of varieties.\nWe were seated, given water and food order taken within 10 mins. The food arrived quickly, with smiles and very hot. The prices are reasonable.  My partner ordered something that I disliked.  She asked me to try it, and I did.  I can honestly say it was the best sautéed mushrooms with garlic that I ever had.  I ate most of them off her plate.  DELICIOUS!!    I would absolutely eat here again."

I did not like thst they could not do sweet tea, but I notice that is also just like a New York thing. They were crazy busy and there was a bit of a wait. The waiters more like they are on skates and its really noisy in there, but overall good. I will not take away from how nice they were, which I didn't see a lot of in New York."

Our Lamb Hogue was a revelation – the lamb was tender and flavorful, perfectly complemented by fresh toppings and a delicious, crusty roll. It was truly a standout sandwich and one of the best I've had in a long time.\nBeyond the incredible food, the service was exceptional. Our server was attentive, friendly, and made us feel genuinely welcome. They were prompt with our order and checked in on us just the right amount without being intrusive. Looking at other five-star reviews, it's clear that this level of quality and service is consistent. Many reviewers praise the friendly staff, the generous portions, and the consistently delicious food across the menu. Westway Diner offers that classic diner feel with a commitment to excellence that shines through in every aspect. It's a true neighborhood gem and a must-visit for anyone looking for a fantastic meal and a welcoming atmosphere. Five stars without hesitation!"

They let us stay slightly after they closed the diner to finish the food. It’s usually really busy here, you might need to queue outside, but it’s worth it! We didn’t have to wait more than 10-15 minutes. Very reasonable prices for the amount of food you get. The pancakes are massive (about 20-30cm wide and very, very fluffy, they melt in your mouth. Besides of having great food, this is the birthplace of Seinfeld!"

Staff was professional and friendly. The food was fantastic. They had a lot of menu options and handled any food accommodations really well.\nAnother guest I saw, with several young children were taken care of well and the kids seemed overall really happy. It's a nice comfortable place that isn't overpriced. The place in whole was pretty clean as were their bathrooms. I'd come back here a few times."

We spent our time visiting highly recommended sights and food spots (Katz‘s, TimeOut Market, ShakeShack Madison Square Park), which was a nice experience. However, Westway had unbeatable service from really friendly and welcoming staff that went out of their way to ensure you‘re comfortable. Everyone will find something to their liking on the menu, and everything was really well priced. In a place as wild and busy as New York, come here if you ever need a short break from it all that you‘ll always enjoy."
