He had the Crab Curry, our friend the Kee Mao Seafood, while I had the Goong Karee. I ate all of my rice which I almost never do. And all of the dish of course. We sampled each other's dishes and all were just excellent (mine wasn't as spicy as theirs though, which was good for me). Didn't have room for desert as the portion sizes are more than enough to fill you up.\n\nI am very grateful we ended up picking Chalong and we'll definitely have to come back again."

Everything was delicious and savory, well-seasoned, and super satisfying. You can tell they really care about the quality of their food.\n\nIt was about 100° outside, but inside was nice and cool thanks to the strong AC, which made lunch even more enjoyable.\n\nFor two people, with sparkling water, tax, and tip, we spent about $62. Felt totally worth it for the quality of food and service we got.\n\nThey did offer 5% off for writing a review, but I didn’t take it this is just my honest take because they really earned the good feedback. Can’t wait to come back and try more from the menu. Highly recommend if you’re in the area and craving Thai food!"

I definitely have not seen a lot of Thai places serve these kinds of dishes, so this is definitely a unique dining experience that is worth trying.\n\nI do personally think that this place might be better suited for parties of 3-4 people. We came as a party of 2, and I just felt like we didn’t get to try a lot of variety. Our two entrees of goat curry and pla tod (the fried fish) had us decently full, but we didn’t get to try any apps and the bill was already $80 (after tax, before tip). And, to be very honest, halfway through the two dishes the flavours began to feel slightly monotonous. We started wanting a bit of lime/acid to brighten the sweetness of the sauce for the fish. The freshness of some appetizers/sides would have been great to break up the flavours, but it would then have been too much food (not to mention more expensive). I feel like if we had 3-4 people, we could have gotten 2-3 apps and some smaller appetizers or sides to pair with our meal, and that would have made it feel more well rounded.\n\nI do want to stress, however, that the food was very well made and came without much wait. While I wish that there was a touch more space between some of the tables, I have to say that the interior of the restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a great vibe. Make a reservation! This is a busy place and there can easily be a wait."

The stir-fried dish with shrimp and bitter beans packed a punch with bold Southern Thai flavors, while the fried rice was fragrant and full of texture. We also got the crispy pork belly, which had a satisfying crunch and a rich flavor that paired so well with the spicy dipping sauce.\n\nThe drinks were just as fun and flavorful as the food!

Sea takes good care of me, like super friendly, especially when I am sweating a lot and my stomach feels burning after having goat curry which is too spicy for me. But the goat is so amazingly cooked in southern Thailand way. And the appetizer girls tastes super yummy. Just trust the recommendations their waiters/ waitresses give"

I love the intensity and authenticity of their Southern Thai flavors—it's a welcome departure from the usual sweetness of other spots. The Kua Kling is a personal favorite; its fiery, dry-fried heat is truly addictive. It’s the kind of place I take friends who appreciate genuine, uncompromisingly spicy and flavorful Thai food."

Pla Tod was hands down the best I’ve had—crispy, perfectly seasoned, and bursting with flavor also made a good combination with crab curry. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for real Thai food and great hospitality!"

The rice dumplings can be skipped but the Pla Tod and Crab Curry are worth the hype. The flavors pack a punch without being overwhelming. Overall, a lovely dinner at Chalong"

Portions were tiny — two people, three dishes and a dessert, all finished because it was too pricey to waste.\n$29 crab curry had half a soft-shell crab. Server said, “That’s how it always is.”\n$33 steamed fish was just a small piece, not even palm-sized, and salty.\nGoat curry was dry and way too salty.\nPaid $142 with tip. I’ve tried tons of Thai spots in NYC — flavors here are average at best, and the portions make it a terrible deal. Definitely not worth it, especially for group meals."

Ordered cocktails which were tasty and unique. The cocktail with the shrimp paste is a must try. We shared the dumplings, which were good but could’ve been better. For entrees we had the southern style pad Thai and the crab curry. Pad Thai was tasty but not overly exciting. Crab curry was delicious and would 100% order again. Perfect spice and lots of lump crab."

The fried fish was crispy and light. The goat curry was rich and savory and paired perfectly with the roti. The shrimp fried rice perfectly was spicy and salty and was accompanied by a ton of fried garlic and shallots which made it taste way better. Definitely recommend!"

Crab curry with a very fragrant and fatty sauce, stir-fried vegetables are crispy, sweet, rich in garlic, just right to eat. Delicious white rice with the characteristic aroma of Thai rice. A great address worthy of keeping beautiful memories in New York."

Everything was tasty although on the pricier side of the scale. Love the complex flavors, layered texture, tasteful presentation and welcoming service."
