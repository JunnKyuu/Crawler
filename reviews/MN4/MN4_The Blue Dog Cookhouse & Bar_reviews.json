            "text": "This restaurant is cute but tiny. Reservations are definitely recommended.\n\nWe had high hopes based on the good reviews, but our experience didn’t live up to the hype.\n\nThe food just wasn’t very good. I got the soup, which was oddly gritty. There’s nothing I love more than deviled eggs, so I got “deviled eggs our way” on the side. I’m really not sure why they’re called deviled eggs, nor why they’re on the menu. I tried guac and chips, and received a hard boiled egg covered in guac. The squash version was a hard boiled egg with a spoonful of squash on top. It was sad and not tasty.\n\nMy friend ordered the steak salad. There’s nothing salad was tiny and the steak was unappetizing. It was thin, fatty, and overcooked.\n\nIt may well be that we didn’t get the best items on the menu, but with all the restaurants in Manhattan, this isn’t one I’d recommend."

I am writing to bring to your attention a concern my friend and I experienced during our visit to The Blue Dog Cookhouse & Bar on Sunday, October 26, 2025.\n\nWhile dining at your establishment, we noticed that the restroom did not have any hot running water available for handwashing. As visitors from out of town, we were quite surprised and disappointed, as proper handwashing facilities are an important part of maintaining hygiene and ensuring a safe dining environment for guests and staff alike.\n\nWe truly enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of your food, but this issue left a negative impression that we hope can be promptly addressed. Please look into this matter to ensure the facilities meet health and safety standards.\n\nThank you for taking the time to review this concern. I look forward to hearing back from you regarding any steps being taken to resolve it.\n\nWarm regards,"

I ordered their braised short ribs dish, and the meat was savoury, tender, and delicious.

Cozy and welcoming space. Highly recommended for a dinner before or after a Broadway show."

The lack of care and attention made the experience feel rushed and dismissive. Definitely not the service we were hoping for on such an occasion."

All delicious and the service was quick. The only thing I didn't like was how cramped it felt, where we were seated. My husband and I shared a bar top with another couple with another small table behind me and every time we'd cut through our food, it'd shake the table, which I felt bad for the other couple sitting with us. I couldn't really sit comfortably either since I didn't want to be in the way of the other small table behind us, so my chair was pulled up all the way towards the table.

We each ordered a drink and main course. Get our drinks, get our food, and sitting and eating. We still had about half our drinks left, and three out of four of our party were done their food, and my friend was still eating. The waiter came and grabbed our empty plates and then proceeded to take my friend’s plate as she was still eating. Waiter then came over with the machine to pay two minutes later. At this point, it was an hour and 15 minutes after our reservation time. We had to ask them to give us a second as we still had drinks to finish. The waiter then proceeded to tell us the hostess was supposed to let us know there was a limited amount of time to eat as they had a reservation after us. Meanwhile, all the groups around us that came at a similar time were not being rushed out the door.\nI don’t know what the average time they are accommodating for their reservations but I think an hour and half is more than appropriate. The food was good but not worth this place for the service."

All the reviews I had read previously talked about the burgers or brunch so I felt a little uncertain about going here for dinner, but I’m glad I did! We had a fabulous dinner and I can’t wait to go back and try a few more of the cocktails. They all looked so good. We definitely recommend the Very Berry Fields (pictured), Vivid Venice, Venetian Spritz, and the Saint Citron Spritz.\n\nWe started with the crispy salmon rice and butternut squash fries as appetizers (see photos). I loved the crispy salmon rice. It’s a fun take on a salmon roll with the salmon diced on a bed of lightly fried rice. The butternut squash fries are different than others I’ve had as the squash is actually mashed or grated on the inside and then fried so they look like mozzarella sticks. They were tasty, especially with the dipping sauce, but a little heavy for me. I didn’t want to spoil my dinner so I only had two!\n\nFor dinner I had the Seared Branzino and my friend had the Pan Seared Scallops. We both really liked our meals. The branzino arrived piping hot (a plus in my book) and had a wonderful crispy skin. It was perfectly cooked and delicious. I loved the flavor of the bits of asparagus and capers on top. And the cauliflower purée was so creamy it felt a little decadent. My friend raved about the scallops with a generous portion of barley, saying the citrus gave the dish a lightness.\n\nWe didn’t have dessert, instead opting for a second drink, but I am curious about the churros and the gelato. They were recommended and sounded amazing.\n\nIt was busy on a Thursday night but the service was quick and very attentive. Thank you to Carlos for making sure we were well taken care of and out in time to get to the show. And the others who kept our water glasses full, plates cleared and food arriving hot!\n\nI love the coziness of this place and look forward to trying brunch!"

In fact, Steve came outside to show us the cut through to the theater when we left. All of the food was delicious. I read reviews with people complaining about no AC, but maybe it's fixed now bc we were comfortable. There was one fan in the corner near us, but the weather was in the 80s that day, and we were fine. Also, I was nervous bc the reviews stressed how close the seats are. I am a large person and sat at the end of the table and was perfectly fine. I was near the bathroom door, and there was still plenty of room for people to walk behind me. Our party ordered the Croquet Madame, Nutella S'mores pancakes, omelet, pretty in pink pancakes, eggs benedict, both vegan options, the Cheesus Christ, CCBLT and Strawberry Taragon salad. Everything came out quickly (about 20 minutes after we ordered) and was delicious. We also had dessert, and everyone liked that as well. We will definitely be back! Don't miss this place before or after a show at NWS."

Very attentive on serving water. The cocktails were great I highly recommend the 1542. The churros are a great dessert choice."

I chose only two, the goat cheese and mushrooms. The goat cheese tasted fresh and delicious, the mushrooms added no noticeable flavor. I have included a photo of a list of optional omelette ingredients. The omelette came with bland potatoes and a nice green salad."

I have ordered the Cheesus Christ burger, it was delicious. Regarding the staff at this restaurant, everyone was professional and kind. I highly recommend this place to anyone seeking decent dining in Hell's Kitchen area."

It’s a beautiful space and the staff were attentive, professional and friendly. Our meals were decadent, the gnocchi was the best I have ever had. Highly recommend this wonderful little place!"

Embrace it!  It’s a small, cute space. Drink was delicious- though they up charged me $5 to switch to Tito’s vodka instead of well gin. Crunchy salmon rice app roughed up the roof of my mouth- yeah, it was that crunchy. Daughter had the kale salad and it was so chock full of raisins it made it too sweet for her. So I took off a star on the food rating for those issues. We’d still come back though. ."

We had some absolutely incredible eats, both savory (cheesy omelet with herby, delicious breakfast potatoes) & sweet (rich mixed berry compote pancakes with lovely pink homemade berry whipped cream, pictured).  Also, top-notch cup of coffee.  I always drink it black and I was not disappointed with the brew!\n\nService was warm and attentive and space was very beautiful.  Only downside is the size—be ready to be very intimate with your fellow diners!  But in our opinion, totally worth it for the food and the experience.  One of the highlights of our trip to NYC!"

We were 3 people and we only asked for 3 changes.\nSwitch scrambled eggs for sunny side up\nNo mayo in a sandwich\nChange blue cheese for parmesan cheese\nFor every change he would laugh in our faces, not a kind laugh or anything, rolling his eyes and under breath laugh which I ended up telling him I didn’t know changes were so funny.\nBesides that, everything else was great, food came out quick, one of the girls was always refilling water, asking if we needed something.\nThe laughing guy just came after with the check."

Burgers were perfect, cooked and seasoned well in a tasty good textured bun, the truffel fries were a flavour orchestra, service was exceptional. The choclate cake icing was too buttery for me, but if someone prefers the butter flavour, should definetly order it."

The avocados had a good flavor and the dip was creamy but it could have used more lime & salt & some hot sauce. We then shared the Homemade Crab Cake Benedict ($28) and the Garden Chicken Tartine ($24). Both were delicious. The crab cake was lightly breaded and flavorful...super fresh. The poached egg was perfectly cooked with firm whites and thickly running egg yolk. The tarragon chicken salad was also well prepared with the perfect amount of mayo.  Both were served with fresh mixed greens topped with a light & citrusy vinaigrette.\n\nThe Pina Mezcalita was a refreshing and potent mezcal based cocktail and the Maria Bloody Mary had a great kick.\n\nThe churros weren't my favorite because I found them too dense but the flavor was good. Their coffee as always was hot and strong.\n\nThe service was friendly, attentive, & efficient. Marlon was great! The ambiance is very much yuppies at brunch. Make of it what you will.\n\nDisclaimer: It is a small place and they always make sure you know you only have your table for 1.5 hours although I've never been kicked out for going over!"

But if you are able to squeeze in a snag a table, it is well worth it!\nThey made it clear we could only stay for an hour and at times we felt rushed but the food…. My goodness the food made up for it all!\nThis is not an exaggeration- the French Onion soup could quite possibly be the best I’ve ever had.  And I get French Onion ALL the time.  Incredible.\nThe drinks were fantastic, the tots were perfectly crispy, the brussel sprouts were out of this world and the Eggs Benny were delicious.  I could eat here ever Sunday but unfortunately we don’t live in the area.  Friendly staff and cool vibes even though it’s loud.\nThanks for making our Sunday brunch so out of this world.  Highly recommended!!!"
