I made reservations about a week in advance to be sure we’d have plenty of time, and everything worked out perfectly. The atmosphere is warm and friendly, and the service was excellent — everyone was so helpful in explaining the menu since we weren’t familiar with Venezuelan and Spanish fusion food.\n\nWe tried two tapas — the shrimp in garlic sauce was delicious — and the Montaditos Venezuela, which ended up being our favorite dish of the night. We also shared the seafood paella, which was full of flavor and beautifully presented. We’re visiting from Wisconsin, and we both said we wish we had a place like this back home! Highly recommend for a fun and flavorful dinner before a show."

The empanadas are perfectly golden and flaky with a creamy dipping sauce that’s downright addictive, and the arepitas topped with shredded beef, plantains, and cheese are next-level comfort food. Everything tastes freshly made and full of heart, from the first bite to the last sip of their crisp, fruit-filled sangria. The staff is friendly, the energy is vibrant, and every dish feels like it was crafted with love. A total 10/10 experience — this place deserves all the praise!"

The paella was an interesting one , it was not super bad but also the flavors did not wow me , it did have great amount of fresh seafood but rice was lil too heavy .

Their food is best described as Venezuelan-style Spanish cuisine, likely reflecting their own roots.\n\nThis place isn’t exactly an unmissable fine-dining experience, but it’s a genuine, affordable family restaurant run with heart — and places like this are becoming increasingly rare.

We went to EZ Paella & Tapas and from the moment we walked in it felt welcoming and cozy. The menu had so many nice choices and we ended up ordering a lot of different items to try.\n\nEverything we got was tasty but my favorite was the shrimp. The flavor was rich and fresh, and it really reminded me of the comfort meals my lola cooks back home in the Philippines. Eating it made me feel like I was back at our family table, sharing food and stories. It’s not easy to find that kind of feeling when you are far from home, so it was really special for me.\n\nThe staff were also friendly and made sure we had everything we need. The service was quick even though there were other customers, and the atmosphere was nice for relaxing after a long day. Thank you EZ Paella & Tapas for the amazing food and for making me feel close to home even when I’m far away."

We went with a few appetizers and finished it off with the seafood paella. The paella doesn't look like much but the flavors that come out of that bowl are quite bright and dynamic. There is a lot of shrimp in there which you don't see in the picture on the menu. We added chorizo to ours and I loved it. It added a nice contrast in texture since everything else had a softer feel. My friend didn't love it but I think it was a great add-on.\n\nWe ordered the half-carafe of red sangria and it was such a good choice. Good size and the flavor was pure. It didn't taste like other sangrias that have fat too many extra stuff in it.\n\nYou know I love great service. The food can be A+ but if the service is lacking, it's a huge disappointment. But out server Cataldo was amazing. He was knowledgeable, patient, and gave the best recommendations.\n\nI really like this place. I love how small and cozy it is. Big restaurants stress me out but this place had such a nice vibe, I can't wait to go back. Thank you Cataldo for a great experience."

            "text": "Went here for lunch today with my friend. This is a small place, nothing fancy, but food is amazing. We started with pincho caprese skewers with pesto sauce which was delicious. Red sangria and passion fruit sangria was refreshing and delicious. We shared the chicken paella with chorizo. The chorizo gave it the little bit of saltiness it needed. We finished with churros with chocolate and caramel which were  crispy on the outside and light and fluffy. Absolutely delicious! Highly recommended!"

I started with the soup of the day — a creamy potato leek with haddock — and it was absolutely delicious, rich and perfectly seasoned. I also tried the skewered octopus, which was tender, flavorful, and beautifully grilled. The service was impressively fast and friendly, making the whole experience smooth and enjoyable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for quality seafood and great service!"

            "text": "It’s honestly such a shame that they can absolutely nail their appetisers and give me the worst paella I’ve ever had. Let’s start with the good.\n\nThe meatballs, super flavourful very crispy I highly recommend.\nThe funny thing with the meat on top very nice too it had sweetness, crunch and saltiness from the meats.\nMeat puffs were delicious too, filling is hearty and the flavourful is wonderful.\n\nHowever the paella told a different story. The rice was soggy (like really soggy) and the saffron flavour did not come through. It was weird. Peas tasted frozen and they were discoloured. The rice with the bits of chorizo (I think) made it too salty. The seafood was also not fresh, the mussels took quite a bit of effort to open and it tasted like it had been left out for hours. It was lw bad that I didn’t even finish it.\n\nOverall, I’m just gonna put it simply, just come here for their appetisers their paella sucks."
