This restaurant has such great reviews normally.  It makes me wonder if they downgraded their quality for the event.\n\nThere was only one server bringing out the food on the smallest tray ever- which could only fit about four plates of food which took forever.  He also looked pretty unhappy with having to deal with so many people which I understand, but they should’ve hired another person for the event.\n\nMaybe this event was great before someone posted about it on Instagram, but it did not live up to the expectations that were put out there. It seems like many people were unhappy with the experience bc it was not what was advertised."

People bumping into each other and spilling wine. They brought out 2 kinds of pasta. One was good. The other terrible. I didn’t finish mine. The lady next to me said that she placed her half eaten pasta plate back in the tray they were serving from and they served it to someone else!! 😳 I do want to call out the servers. They navigated the crowd and served with such patience. They should not be put through an environment like this. I would not recommend. They need to change many things.

Got there at 5.40 and had 1-2 people in line. By 6pm the line was around the corner, at which point the \"manager\" or \"owner\" told us we needed to go at the back of the line from waiting in front of the entrance.\n\nBy 6.15 we had finally made it inside and it was already too packed to even stand (the only option during Pasta Night). Decided it wasn't worth the \"good vibes\" or even the $20, so went next door and had delicious tapas and paella. By 7pm the inside was packed and outside there was still a line of people."

Abbiamo preso due antipasti e 3 paste, tutte molto buone, avrei preso anche un dolce ma eravamo troppo pieni.

It’s a cozy and charming spot, impeccably clean and the warm welcome from Ludovico, with his radiant energy and contagious smile, sets the perfect tone from the very first moment.\nThey’ve opened slightly more than a week ago and the location (on 9th Ave and 50th Street) is prime! I’ve felt home and the vibe there is genuinely a 100% Italian!\nI started with “Prosciutto & Burrata” as an appetizer, served in a bed of arugula and Ludovico kindly put some fresh bread on the side, both the Prosciutto Crudo and Burrata were absolutely phenomenal. The Italian prosciutto was flavorful, and the burrata melted in my mouth and left that sweet and milky aftertaste I could have literally every single day.\nFor my main, I went for pasta, with the “Caserecce and Zucchini”, part of their lunch special (with several different pasta options for just $15! A great idea for Manhattan!). The pasta was perfectly al dente (to my taste a minute more wouldn’t have hurt), but that zucchini sauce? Outrageously delicious!!! I wanted to spread it on everything.\nTo finish with a sweet note, Ludovico suggested a classic tiramisù, just like my nonna used to make it and it was so good It transported me straight back to my childhood. I also got offered one Sicilian Cannoli with a remarkably good ricotta cheese inside!\nSo happy a place like Pasta Eater ‘N Go opened in New York and I personally wanted to give a huge shoutout to Ludovico and the team, for the kindness and hospitality.\nOpening a restaurant like this in NYC is admirable, God knows it’s not easy, and they’re doing it beautifully. Wishing them all the best because they truly deserve it!\nCan’t wait to be back soon to try more of their delicious pasta dishes!"

I had a seafood salad that was outstanding, and the zucchini blossoms appetizer was equally delicious. My pasta with porcini mushrooms and authentic Parmesan cheese was incredible—even better than what I had in Naples, Italy. My friend’s seafood pasta was just as delicious.\n\nThe desserts were out of this world—the tiramisu was even better than what I can make at home, and the cannolis were so fresh that we devoured them all. We also had the pleasure of chatting with the owner, Ludgi, who welcomed us with warmth and kindness.\n\nI hope Eater N Go maintains its food quality and doesn't change anything, because I'll definitely be back with my friends.

Honestly, it doesn't need anything extra—not even Marco P! 😉 This place is already doing everything right.\n\nHighly recommend for a satisfying, late-night Italian bite with a good dry Italian red wine."

The truffle pasta was to die for but the carbonara pasta had way too much black pepper on it we couldn’t even taste the guanciale. That’s the only thing that made me give 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that we loved the Chianti we got and the atmosphere of the restaurant. Perfect spot to have dinner before our Broadway show!"

(detto da un italiano che qui a New York ci vive)\n\nFinalmente un posto che riesce a portare la vera essenza della cucina italiana a New York! Sono rimasto senza parole davanti alla pasta alle vongole: saporita, bilanciata, con un profumo di mare che mi ha riportato a Napoli.\nLa pasta era perfetta, al dente, olio leggero, cremosa come deve, prezzemolo fresco e vongole generose già sgusciate. Un capolavoro di semplicità e gusto.\n\nUn altro piatto che merita una standing ovation è la pasta alla Nerano: cremosa, avvolgente, con quel mix perfetto tra zucchine fritte e formaggio che solo chi conosce bene la ricetta originale può replicare. Ogni boccone è un tuffo in Costiera, un equilibrio straordinario tra comfort food e delicatezza. Mai trovata così fuori dall’Italia!\n\nE poi il tiramisù… che dire. Cremoso, delicato, con il giusto equilibrio tra caffè, mascarpone e cacao. Nulla a che vedere con le versioni americane piene di panna: questo è il vero tiramisù italiano. Ogni cucchiaiata era pura poesia.\n\nComplimenti sinceri allo staff di Pasta Eater N Go e soprattutto a Ludovico: si vede che c’è passione, cura per gli ingredienti e amore per la tradizione. Tornerò prestissimo e consiglierò questo posto a chiunque voglia assaggiare la vera cucina italiana. Bravissimi!"

Purtroppo perché il cibo non è stato all’altezza delle aspettative. Sicuramente a New York non ci aspettavamo un autentico e superlativo piatto di pasta, ma la carbonara non era proprio buona. La pasta era scotta e spezzettata. La salsa non ricordava la carbonara. La Caesar salad era priva di proteine, un piattino di insalata con salsa a 15 $. In linea con i prezzi di questa città ma non con la qualità. Abbiamo visto le altre recensioni positive quindi non so se abbiamo avuto sfortuna noi :/"
