It’s a place where you can taste the real essence of China—highly recommended for anyone who loves authentic Chinese food!"

Offering spicy clolorful dishes with modern plating. The menu is a humongous book with almost 200 items to choose from. Also do try the special lunch deals that comes with rice, soup for a steal of only $12 heck of a deal for the area. Will also get a show with your meal sometimes from the kitchen😂. Place is decked out with deep red wood furniture, red lantern and festive cutouts. Service can be a bit slow when they are packed at times."

I've eaten at countless Szechaun restaurants across the country, north to south — and this is the only one that's truly authentic, no exceptions. The flavors are exactly like those in Chengdu's Szechaun cuisine — unforgettable and rich — with no attempt to cater to American or other Asian tastes. The aroma lingers and is absolutely delightful. Highly recommended.\nI personally packed up all the leftovers, added more meat and vegetables at home, and cooked two more meals using the original sauce. The flavor remained strong and distinctly Szechaun — it lingered in my mouth like music that echoes. Friends who saw the photos I shared thought I had gone back to Szechaun. For anyone wanting to experience Chengdu’s flavors, this place will satisfy all your cravings — no need for a long journey. Strongly recommend!"

            "text": "\"Authentic\" is a word that is heavily overused in the Chinese Restaurant scene in NYC. Many restaurants using precooked meal set or with an regionally inaccurate flavor brandish such label. But this restaurant EARNED it.\n\nI asked the server and I say, hey be completely honest with me, recommend dish you think it's really good. And here we go. Mapo Tofu. And I ordered Sliced Beef because my girlfriend love beef.\n\nThe Tofu is exactly the flavor you find in Sichuan. I am poor in language but I am just going to say it's aromatic and silky, and not too spicy at all. Great with rice! The rice could be a bit more soft to my taste though personally. (Real Szechuan cuisine is not supposed to be supppper spicy but aromatic and numbing). 18.95$\n\nThe sliced beef is also very good. The portion is big, and I can tell they use quality cooking oil. No complaints. 32.95$ is not in the cheaper end but I think it's worth it in terms of portion and quality.\n\nOnly two downsides I found (if you care). The servers are friendly but a bit short staffed so it's actually slow in a busy night. My suggestion is an easy fix: if server looked around more every time they come out of the kitchen, be much better. Still, I will accept for the food quality haha.\nThe atmosphere is good, clean, but not fancy or super polished. It is definitely not one of those newly opened \"upscale Chinese restaurant\" with lavish interior. Again, not my focus at all.\n\nRegarding price, be prepared to shell out 25-40$ per person if you want an authentic experience and a selection of dishes. Yes it's not cheap but comparatively it's acceptable considering the quality compared to other restaurant.\n\nBy the way the famous Chef Wang is in the kitchen. I guess he either cooks personally or closely supervise the process. He is very friendly!\n\nPS: Photo with many celebrities and Bernie Sanders! Another reason to go if you are a Bernie fan or doesn't hate him haha. But hey the food is universal right?\n\nPS2: I must be completely honest. Yes they right now offer a free desert (about 8$ in value) if you leave a review and show it to the staff. Yes I am a lazy person and I usually won't leave review. But hey I can tell you that this free dessert did not change a bit my assessment of this restaurant thus the content of review."

            "text": "I recently enjoyed an incredibly authentic Sichuan cuisine experience in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. The menu offered so many delicious options that the four of us decided to rely on the recommendations from the servers. If you're looking for some spicy dishes, don't miss the sliced beef in spicy broth and the braised fish fillet with Sichuan pepper. I even saved some of the spicy broth in my fridge, which I use to make noodles from time to time.\n\nTo balance out our meal, we also tried and loved some non-spicy dishes, including tofu with crab roe and stir-fried bean sprouts in garlic sauce.\n\nMy go-to dish at any Sichuan restaurant is the dry pot, which is also served here. However, if you don't want to pick bones, I would recommend avoiding the pork rib tasty pot."
