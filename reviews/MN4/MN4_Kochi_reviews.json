I felt like there could’ve been more savory or slightly larger portions.\nWe were also celebrating my partners birthday which the host asked us about when seating is but didn’t get a candle or anything at the end which we saw was given to other tables. The back door by the bar where we were seating was kept open for half the dinner and was cold and also didn’t make the space feel as inviting. The service felt a bit disorganized and overall not worth over $500 for 2 people with drinks. Mari which is owned by the same chef felt much more inviting and made us more satisfied and lived up the Michelin star would recommend that over Kochi any day."

Most dishes are kept lighter than we're usually exposed to in most American Korean dishes in order to keep you going through the full milti course meal. The fish and meats were both perfectly cooked and had many flavors of the flame they were grilled with. A scallop dish upon pickled root vegetables was a highlight of the tiny plates. The meal ended beautifully with a 3 piece ballet of sorbet, banana, and creams. The staff was as exceptionally accommodating as the flavors. The star was deserved."

Drink sizes were full and the size of the dishes felt appropriate. We were there for over 2 hours and spent $722, well worth it.\n\nDecided to give it a second try for our 10th anniversary. Wouldn’t say I was underwhelmed, but just whelmed… some dishes were still great like the signatures, and the pallet cleanser was one of the best….but some just made me hungrier because they didn’t hit. Portions felt smaller as well. We did the drink pairing again, but this time it felt very small. Pours didn’t even make it past the angle at the bottom of the glass. Also felt very rushed. Were were collecting drinks to try and savor as dishes dropped. There was no time to savor the compliments of them when temperature was against you. This time we paid…$728 for 2 people… and was under and hour and a half. Way too much money for what this was-second time around.\n\nTakeaway: Just say it’s your bday or anniversary so at least you get another dish on the house."

They sat us at a table in a tent on the avenue's sidewalk. The temperature outside was 38 degrees.\n\nFour Dura Heat model DH2304S heaters that burn kerosene heated the tent.\n\nI've had asthma since about 2000, and was worried that the heaters would harm me, so I asked a Kochi manager to move us inside. They said that they couldn't because they had no free tables.\n\nThey eventually moved us inside, but even there we smelled kerosene in the air.\n\nShortly after we left Kochi that evening, I felt weak and lethargic from my involuntary exposure to the air pollution emitted by the heaters. In the days and weeks that followed, I felt weak, and suffered muscle aches, headaches, and coughing. My quality of life sank: I stopped socializing with friends, my wife and I canceled a vacation and stopped having sex. I stopped exercising. I watched every Seinfeld episode.\n\nOn Monday, May 20, 2024 I started exhibiting symptoms of sepsis, a life-threatening condition. I was confused and extremely fatigued. Fortunately, my sister, an infectious disease MD, recognized this, and my wife and sister took me to Cedars Sinai Medical Center, where I required 4 days of treatment.\n\nIt took me another couple of months to fully regain my strength.\n\nSince then I've learned that the caution warning on the model DH2304S heaters says \"ALWAYS OPERATE HEATERS WITH DOORS OF ROOM OPEN.\" and the owner's manual says \"RISK OF INDOOR AIR POLLUTION USE HEATER ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. People with breathing problems should consult a physician before using the heater.\"\n\nBut the tent had no ventilation. And Kochi did not post a warning about the dangers the heaters posed to \"people with breathing problems\".\n\nNow I'm fully recovered, but I nearly died. And the experience destroyed about 4 months of my life.\n\nKochi, you should stop using kerosene heaters. Dura Heat, you should stop selling heaters to restaurants.\n\nDiners, beware."

            "text": "I dined at Kochi today with my husband and sister, and unfortunately, the experience fell far short of expectations—especially for a Michelin-starred restaurant. The atmosphere was underwhelming and felt very average, not what you’d anticipate for a $200-per-person meal.\n\nThe food itself tasted decent, though it was noticeably salty. But the bigger issue: both my sister and I became extremely sick shortly after the meal. My sister had diarrhea before even leaving the restaurant, and I followed 20 minutes later. This is completely unacceptable, especially at this price point.\n\nI’ve dined at many omakase and tasting-menu restaurants across NYC, even ones at much lower price points, and I’ve never experienced any stomach issues before. This was a first—and not in a good way.\n\nSafe to say, we won’t be returning and cannot recommend Kochi based on our experience."

Food is mediocre at best (at least 2 out of 6 savory dishes were salty) and tables were so close to each other that I could clearly hear the conversation of the people who sat at the table next to us. I don’t think the experience and the food here worth the money we paid for. On top of that, we all suffered from the diarrhea. The only good thing is the service we received from the servers, but it doesn’t compensate for the bad quality of the food we had here.\n\nPlease don’t come to this restaurant. There are many better restaurants in NYC. This restaurant is overhyped by the Michelin title and you will more likely be disappointed like us if you dine here."

Toward the end of the meal we realized there was a fan behind us but it was off.  When turned on that helped a bit.  The waiter should have turned it on at the beginning.  There was also a fan in front of us but the table under it had aimed it at them so we weren't getting any wind from that.  The food was very good, especially the halibut, wagyu and bibimbap.  the \"hwe\" was bland and the carrot sorbet didn't come together.  The final dessert was just OK.

This spot was on my list to try out so glad I did but I don't think it was so good I'd go back. If you're in the area, check it out. Sometimes you can leave prix fixe a little hungry but didn't feel that way with this spot. What makes me give it a 4 (and maybe a smidge under 4) is that the food wasnt wow. The best dish was the Wagyu and morels. The korean flavours didn't seem integrated and sometimes a little superficial (adding a bit of fermented paste or gochujang isn't quite enough). The perilla and tomato jelly with Hamachi could've had potential but fell a bit short. Some of the dishes like the sorbet and and banana milk did a good job of incorporating the essence of Korean cuisine without being too much on the nose. Long story short, give it a try if you're in the area and there's a seat open but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way."

            "text": "Everything about appetizer/main/dessert/drinks/service was amazing. Pleasantly sophisticated taste experiences with lots of details and cares made it such a good memory.\n\n-I really enjoyed it overall because I got the impression that menus here tried very hard to make right balance between keeping Korean cuisine’s identity and yet appealing to non-Korean folks. For example of Eggplant Twigim (one of my fav), the rice cake with its sweet spicy sauce well reminded common street food in Korea, but its overall taste quality is so elevated and putting chestnut hummus on the rice cake made it completely different taste experience. (good way)\n-The 2nd most interesting menu was Corn Soup which came out as the first appetizer. It had three different steps of having it and each steps provided completely different taste experiences of savory/crunchy/comforting. Not just tastes were good, but it made me so excited for what was coming next so it was one of perfect way to serve its job as opening appetizer.\n-The most “interesting” one was actually cocktail Nangmeyon but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you already well know what common Korean cold noodle is like and that you like it. Strictly speaking for taste perspective, I liked Jeju Escape better as it had very good balance of bitterness and fruity sweetness.\n-Not that it was bad, but adding sea urchin to snowcrab bibimbap might not be well worth it because the menu as is already provides amazing flavor, so spending more bucks on extra sea urchin didn’t feel like well money spent.\n\nThis was probably the best restaurant experience I had in Manhattan for this particular year. No wonder I will be coming back again.\n\n에피타이저,메인,디저트,칵테일,서비스 그 무엇 하나 빠지지 않고 다 환상적이었고 너무 맛있게 다 잘 먹었습니다. 하나하나 디테일과 정성이 느껴졌고 가장 중요한 음식맛이 진짜 좋았습니다.\n\n요 몇년 사이 한국이라는 나라의 브랜드와 이미지가 올라가면서 맨하탄에 가격대가 있는 fine dining식의 한식당이 제법 생겼는데, 이런 곳들이 한국인 시점에서는 음식이 맛있다고 느껴지더라도 \"근데 이게 어디가 한식이지?\" 하게 되는 경우가 종종 있어요. 근데 꼬치의 메뉴들이 맛도 있으면서 더 인상 깊었던건, 한국음식이라는 정체성도 잘 보여주면서 비한국인들에게도 매력적인 음식이 될 수 있도록 고민을 많이 했다는 인상을 받았기 때문인것 같습니다. 한 예로, 떡꼬치의 경우 한국인이 평범하게 생각할 수 있는 그 떡꼬치의 겉에 빵가루 같은 것을 묻혀 튀겨서 맛의 격을 한참 올린 동시에, 옆에 견과류 소스를 같이 제공했기 때문에 그 소스에 묻혀 먹으면 흔히 아는 맛인 매콤달콤 떡꼬치와는 다른 아예 새로운 맛조합을 즐길 수가 있습니다.\n\n또 메뉴 여기저기에 한식 이름을 가감없이 썼다는 것도 흥미로웠습니다. 칵테일 \"냉면\"의 경우에는 냉면을 좋아하시는 분들에겐 한번 권해보고 싶네요. 술로써의 매력이 대단하다고 까지는 못하겠지만, 술이라는 그 경계를 지키면서 냉면육수의 맛을 이만큼까지 재현시켰다는게 너무 재밌었습니다.\n\n마지막 디저트인 아이스크림 돼지바는 설마 제품을 보게되나 싶었는데 이런 맙소사 수제 돼지바가 나오더군요. 한국인에게 익숙한 그 돼지바를 연상시키는 초코맛과 바삭바삭한 맛에 딸기크림으로 레벨업을 해서 이것도 정말 재밌고 너무 맛있게 잘 먹었습니다.\n\n딱 한가지 아쉬운 소리를 하자면 게살비빔밥의 경우 굳이 성게를 추가할 필요까지는 없는것 같습니다. 이미 메뉴 그 자체의 맛이 너무 깊고 좋았고, 그래서 성게를 추가하는게 오히려 좀 메뉴 그대로의 맛을 흐뜨러뜨린게 아닌가 하는 생각이 들었습니다. 굳이 돈 더 써가며 추가할만한 의미까지는 없는것 같아요.\n\n개인적으로 올해 뉴욕에서 먹은 음식 중에 가장 만족도가 높았습니다. 꼭 또 오겠습니다."

For a korean inspired place, you could barely tell except for some dishes which then were probably the best ones of the night."

The crew definitely takes the endeavor seriously, and it is reflected in the quality of the meal. I had the beverage pairing, which was also wonderful. All of the Wines or sake were selected with care and accompanied each dish beautifully.\n\nThe service was extremely professional and friendly, it was a pleasure to sit at the counter and watch the team preparing each course.\n\nDefinitely would like to go back here for another special occasion, or perhaps just a fun evening to treat ourselves."

I honestly thought I wouldn't like everything because I didn't have the high class palate and I was so nervous about the social environment, but I was so wrong. It was an amazing experience. We ate ALL 9 dishes on the tasting menu. I highly recommend the A5 wagyu upgrade! All the dishes were very distinct and had tons of different flavors. It was so delicious and the service was incredible. They were so friendly and I had a great night!"

Every dish was incredibly delicious—elevated without being overly fancy or trying too hard, just genuinely good food. Unlike some tasting menus, I actually left feeling nicely full. They were also fantastic about accommodating dietary restrictions, which made the experience even better. For the quality and creativity of the dishes, the value is outstanding. The atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, not stuffy, and the service was excellent. I enjoyed every single course!"

            "text": "Korean traditional course meal distilled into a fusion kochi (skewer) form.\n\nAmong Michelin-starred Korean fine dining spots, Kochi offers one of the most unique concepts. Rather than focusing on fusion or highlighting specific dishes, Kochi presents a complete Korean multi-course experience (each dish representing a classic element of traditional dining). For those unfamiliar with Korean course meals, it might feel a bit mundane, but for me, it carried a fun and nostalgic charm.\n\nA typical Korean course meal begins with a light soup and raw seafood, and Kochi’s first two starters beautifully reflected this tradition. Along with the Chef’s special Abalone, these starters were elevated with playful sweet acidity. The course then transitioned seamlessly into savory acidity with the Octopus Twigim and Halibut. The halibut was my favorite dish from the first half of the meal—a creative take on dried pollock bean sprout soup (콩나물북어국). The Jiri consommé deepened the flavors with its umami and spice, while the lightly fried tofu and delicate halibut added textural dimensions to the dish.\n\nJust like in a Korean meal, the entrées weren’t limited to just one. Instead, they were divided into 3 parts: 2 meat dishes and, of course, bibimbap—because no Korean meal feels complete without it. My favorite was the American wagyu—decently fatty, paired with a rich truffle sauce, and the chewy yet slightly creamy barley risotto made it very satisfying. On the other hand, the flank steak felt like a simple bulgogi with a different pork cut—not particularly innovative and probably the plainest dish of the evening.\n\nThen the Mandarin Sorbet. Best palate cleanser I’ve ever had. The way they layered textures and acidity in this seemingly simple dish was divine. The bursting texture of finger lime, silky smooth calico foam, and the bright citrus supreme all came together beautifully. The white sesame dessert was a tad disappointing as they subtle sesame and ginger flavors were completely overpowered by caramel. Thankfully, the chef provided a complimentary passionfruit posset, and this was absolutely fire."

The food was impeccable, the hospitality was warm and welcoming, and the atmosphere was cozy yet comfortable.\n\nGood hospitality and great food. We said \"yes\" to all the upgrades. Worth it.

There were 2 dishes that seemed too salty (a broth), and then there was one that seemed to use too much miso or maybe bonito? Then, there is no dishes to cleanse or prepare your pallet for the next course.\nAlso, during one presentation of a dish, a soup base was poured over fish, and the server spilled a few drops on the table but never attempted to clean it. If we were not paying so much, it would not be a big deal at all, but I've been to steakhouses that were more attentive.\nThe staff did provide us with 3 different desserts for our anniversary. That was nice."

            "text": "Visited in Feb 2025\n\nHad made a reservation for dinner at Kochi before catching a Broadway show. The tasting menu is a 9 course experience with one optional additional course (the Chef’s Special) for an additional amount. I did add the additional Chef’s special which was an abalone course and it was fantastic. There was also the option to upgrade a couple of courses in the menu with additional premium ingredients for those wishing to.\n\nThe tasting menu is very reasonably priced (versus other similar Michelin star restaurants in NY) and the dinner was a good amalgamation of creative preparations, traditional flavours and an overall unpretentious experience. The restaurant definitely deserves its one Michelin star.\n\nFor drinks, I ordered a couple of cocktails (the Fig Negroni and the Spiced Korean Pear Margherita) and both were quite good. Would definitely recommend Negroni lovers to try the Fig Negroni. There is a also a detailed wine list for folks who are interested.\n\nService was impeccable.\n\nOverall, the dinner was a very nice experience and I’d definitely recommend folks to visit Kochi if they’re interested in Korean fine dining."

We paid $476 for two, without the wine pairing. A few notes that the music was quite loud and the wagyu did not come out hot.

The 9 course tasting menu is truly a lifechanging experience for your tastebuds and certainly for the eye. Hard to say which course I enjoyed the most, but probably the grilled Octopus and the pork chops. Maybe the watermelon gazpacho or the corn ice cream. The price is comparably cheap for what you get here, given that Kochi has been awarded a Michellin star. Wine and cocktails also just fantastic.\nTiny, tiny room for improvement is the look and feel of the tables - I gave been sitting outside. Either use tablecloth or make sure the tables don’t look like old, cheap, plastic stuff that you would find anywhere else in New York. Your tableware, though, was stunning and beautiful.\n100% recommendation for fine dining in New York."

Definitely book in advance, and be aware that there are a lot of fish dishes (but they’re all very different in presentation and taste, so no flavor fatigue!).\nGreat date spot or fancy dinner for a special occasion.
