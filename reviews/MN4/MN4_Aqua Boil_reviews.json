The Cajun spice was so good- just the right kick and packed with rich, mouthwatering taste!\n\nOur waitress Bell was phenomenal. She was friendly, attentive, and made sure we had the best experience possible. She really went above and beyond to make our night really fun!\n\nA huge shoutout as well to Sean and Tum, who were both so welcoming and added to the amazing vibe of the evening.\n\nIf you’re looking for fresh seafood, amazing flavors, and top-notch service, Aqua Boil NYC is definitely the place to go. Highly recommended! 🦞🔥💙"

You can tell they genuinely care about every guest and love what they do. The food was incredible (the seafood boil was fresh and full of flavor!), but honestly, it’s the vibe they create that makes this place special.\n\nThey treated us like family, checked in often, and made sure everything was perfect from start to finish. You can feel the good energy as soon as you walk in — great music, great food, great people.\n\nHighly recommend coming here and asking for Cherbel and Tanya — they’ll make sure you have the best time!"

It was more than enough actually! The soft shelled crab is amazing too but the mad ocean combo was insanely nice!\n\nThe service was nice! I didn't get your name (one of the employees wearing a black cap) you were very nice and we found it great!"

It turned out the owner of the shop came from the same hometown then it just felt like home. They were a little bit under staff at the time so we needed to wait a little bit longer than we thought but definitely worth the time.\n\nWe ordered shrimp and snow crab boil with Cajun sauce and added clams separately. Snow crab is the MVP. So sweet and so moist. Super fresh. The cajun sauce was also tasty, a little spicy and creamy. They offered a lot of sauce. If you’re Thai or familiar with Thai food, you can ask for the Thai style spicy seafood sauce as well. Their corn rib also super goood. Went so well with the ranch so don’t miss it."

The food itself was really great, it had good flavor and spice... however we got shrimp head off and ate almost all of the shrimp when I realized that they had not been deveined. It's not a horrible thing but it is disgusting! That is the shrimps poop and to be honest no one really wants to eat that. That's really the only reason for the 3 stars. Just making people aware and maybe to let the cooks know that that is supposed to be done before cooking and serving."

            "text": "My first seafood boil experience and I was not disappointed!!! I ordered the Cajun fries and a boil with snow crab, shrimp and corn, garlic butter, medium spice and it was DELICIOUS!!! Also had their peach margarita and they weren't shy on their pours. While it seemed that the servers were maybe a bit overwhelmed, if you flag them down they help you immediately. It's a messy, fun way to enjoy fresh seafood - I do recommend making a reservation though because it was a busy place!"

Aber auch hier war die Versuchung zu groß, als dass ich mir das durch die Lappen gehen lasse.\n\nServiert wird in einem tollen Ambiente diese Tüte, die man sich zusammenstellen kann. Ich habe noch nie solche großen Garnelen gesehen! Lecker. Gute Marinade. Mit den Lobsters werde ich nicht warm, ist Geschmackssache!\n\nMan bekommt eine Schere und einen „Knacker“, um den Panzer bzw. die Schale zu knacken. Einen Eimer, um den Abfall reinzuwerfen.\n\nService aufmerksam, schnell und freundlich. Aber der Preis knallt halt: Für zwei Personen werdet ihr 100 Dollar los. Muss man sich überlegen und auch nur hin, wenn man diese Art von Fishfood mag."

Our party of six adults, two toddlers, and a baby felt right at home, thanks to their super friendly staff.\n\nThey serve various appetizers and seafood options with ingredients delivered daily and fresh. The portion was generous and more than enough for six adults at a reasonable price. The seafood combo was fresh and flavorful, and the lobster roll was absolutely amazing.\n\nHighly recommend for a delicious and welcoming dining experience!"

I went once last summer and again recently. The clams now have massive shells that prob take up most of the weight and they don’t give corn as a basic set anymore."

            "text": "We were recommended to. Is it this casual eatery. They offer seafood, lobster, snow crab, clams, muscles, and shrimps cook in different sauces or Cajun, butter lemon etc. we had shrimp and snow crab in mild Cajun sauce. Clams in lemon butter. Muscles in black pepper. Also Shrimp gumbo, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts as for side dishes. The seafood was quite fresh apart from 2-3 shrimp that were a bit doubtful. The clams taste good but they were too high, hence very chewy. The muscles were so size fresh and juicy. The gumbo and all the side dishes were very good. Our server was pleasant and he ran around the room efficiently to serve everyone. It’s one of those place that you eat seafood like you eat at home..using both hands!"

Grab a seat, sit down, and order some fresh seafood with their friendly staffs. Put that bib on and slide some gloves because it’s about to get messy! There’s many sauces to choose from and if you’re all about that spiciness, mala sauce is something you gotta try. A beer or cocktail from the Aqua Bar definitely goes well with Aqua Boil’s food. Amazing food, stupendous flavor, outstanding service, and great environment is what you can expect here. Come early and enjoy some $9 happy hour specials until 6pm everyday."

            "text": "I eat boils almost once every two weeks, so I’d consider myself knowledge enough in this area. This place was great, but not amazing. I felt like the sauce was lacking that powerful punch of flavor you expect from a boil, also not enough sauce in the bag either. But, I appreciate how the shrimp heads were prepared, how the fries were done really well, and the seafood was good quality. The service was fairly attentive and nice. Only thing I would change is the way they tell you sit on the bench until your whole party is there, I typically see this in upscale restaurants with bigger parties and tougher reservations, not in a place that wasn’t packed where you’d be putting gloves and a bib on to chomp down on some shrimp. Also, they need to work on their sauce game considering that’s one of the essentials of a great boil."
