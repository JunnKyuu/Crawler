The food was delicious and reasonably priced, the staff were attentive and kind, and the atmosphere was very inviting. One of the best things about this spot is that it isn’t all-you-can-eat, so you never feel rushed and can enjoy your meal at a comfortable pace. You can order as much as you like without breaking the bank 🏦. I even joined their membership program, and I’m happy I did—I can definitely see myself coming back often if they keep up this level of quality."

We were told that it was due to the mushroom being “fresh” but shouldn’t ingredients be washed before serving?? While the servers did apologize, the incident left us feeling uncomfortable and disappointed. Cleanliness and food safety are basic expectations, and this experience fell short. The apology was appreciated, but more could have been done to make things right. In addition, there were two birds that flew into the restaurant.. did not make this experience any better. Unfortunately, we left feeling unsatisfied and would not return."

The restaurant is also very nice and not plain, the looks are great. The seating was 4/5. You can also have about 16 people in your party and there is not a lot of smoking. Nice\nenvironment and quiet. The bad part comes, there isn’t much wheelchair\naccessibility because the chairs and sofas\naren’t wheelchair accessible and it’s hard\n2/5. Another bad is the food is expensive\nfor poor people, 2.5/5. How far is it now, it is about 9.5 minutes from church to place for walking, 3.9 for bus, 3.6 for car,0.7 for plane and 1.2 for train. How many seats, about 50 seats and 46.5 feet of sofa. Large vegetarian meals and food. It’s hard to find parking most times but most are free parking! Best restaurant ever been!"

The quality of the meat served was noticeably poor and did not seem fresh at all. Not long after we got home, both of us experienced severe diarrhea, which we strongly suspect was caused by the food we ate there.\n\nThis was not just an unpleasant dining experience — it was a serious health concern. I urge the restaurant to take a closer look at their food handling and safety standards. Unfortunately, I will not be returning, and I wouldn’t recommend this place to others until improvements are made."

            "text": "I didn’t find the flavor particularly special. It felt similar to most hot pot places, just with different cookware. What really stood out, though, was the server — and not in a good way. She was physically present, but it honestly felt like her soul had left the building. She moved around like she was on autopilot, clearly just waiting for her shift to be over. To make things worse, the guest at the table behind me kept shaking his leg nonstop, which made my chair wobble the entire time. Maybe he wasn’t being very considerate, but I also think the way the tables and chairs are arranged is part of the problem. If you can feel every little movement from the people around you, it takes away from the dining experience. My boyfriend was clearly still interested in eating, but unfortunately, I ended the experience early and we left. I just couldn’t enjoy the meal under those conditions.\nIf you really like the style of Beijing hot pot, it might still be worth a try. After all, it is a very traditional branch of hot pot, and seeing a large plate of meat brought to the table is an impressive sight"

We ordered the spicy lamb scorpion pot as well as a bone broth pot, and everything tasted amazing. The sauce bar is very comprehensive, and there’s a dessert bar where you can get some refreshing dessert such as ice jelly. Besides the food, we really enjoyed the service here—everyone was super helpful and friendly, especially yh, who served our table. We went home with lots of leftover that’s enough to make up another meal. We are definitely going to come back with friends soon!"
