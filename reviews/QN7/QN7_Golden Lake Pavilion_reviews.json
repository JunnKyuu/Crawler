            "text": "If you want the gold standard for Cantonese dim sum in NYC, Lake Pavilion delivers. We came on a busy weekend late morning and the operation was a well-oiled machine—host stand moved quickly, tea hit the table immediately, and carts rolled by nonstop with all the classics done right. Har gow were glassy and snappy, siu mai juicy, rice rolls silky with big, sweet shrimp, and the baked pineapple pork buns were fluffy with that perfect crackly top. Specials were equally strong—the roast duck had crisp skin and tender meat, and the steamed spareribs were super flavorful without being greasy. Service was on point the whole meal: plates swapped, tea refilled, questions answered, and everything arrived hot. Big round tables make it easy for groups and family gatherings, and the room has that lively banquet-hall buzz that makes dim sum fun. Pro tip: arrive before 11 to minimize the wait. Bottom line—excellent food, fast and friendly service, and great value for the quality. Instant favorite."

Every dumpling is bursting with flavor—juicy on the inside, perfectly cooked on the outside, and paired with just the right amount of seasoning and dipping sauce.\n\nThe taste of the food is fantastic—you can tell that every ingredient is fresh and carefully chosen. The shrimp ones are tender and slightly sweet, and full of flavor and not at all boring like in some other places. Every dish I tried made me want more.\n\nIf you’re looking for food that warms your heart and satisfies your cravings, this is the place. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves bold, delicious, comforting Chinese flavors."

We wanted utensils for the kids, water, and order off the menu. We had to ask the dim sum pushers to get someone. Finally came after 10 minutes. When we were leaving, we left a 13% tip sub-par service and food, and the cashier called the manager over. He didn't ask what happened or if I was dissatisfied, he asked for a higher tip!

Worker habits are exacerbated by the high pace and probable poor training. Service workers talk over the dishes and stick their thumbs in the dishes when handing out the food. Multiple workers looked dirty and had smelly breath. My family experienced every painful stereotype involving filth. I’ll be surprised at any rating better than a C. My wife and kids joke about going out to eat here again. It is just nasty. A friend posted a picture that he went there, and I am still baffled by his obliviousness. I would have walked out if it wasn’t an invite to a friends’ gathering.  I give warning to anyone who cares about cleanliness, etiquette, and manners. And I write this with no exaggeration. I had to write this even though I wish them the best. Maybe the management will take heed and hire a rescue before this place gets overrun by vermin and closed for good. That is what it feels like."

In my 40 years of life this is by far the worse dinner I’ve ever had and I’m not even exaggerating.\n\nI booked a party of 4 tables, and 40 people ALL COMPLAINED… we practically just stopped eating half way cause we all lost our appetite. It was sad cause we were celebrating a birthday and this was the biggest disappointment.\n\nWe ordered the party menu sets, and I want to go into detail about how each plate was so bad but it’s not worth my time, I just want to warn everybody out here, do yourself a favor and never come here for dinner. Everything they advertise is false you do not get what you pay for, I basically burned $4000 for nothing but disappointment and disgust."

We always order a lot, and somehow, we finish everything—it’s just that good.\n\nThe must-try dish here is the rice noodle rolls with crispy shrimp. The texture and flavor are absolutely perfect—the crispiness of the wrapper, the rich sauce—it’s something I’ve never found at any other dim sum place. Highly recommended!\n\nOther standouts include the siu mai, har gow, and especially the deep-fried pineapple and BBQ pork bun. The bun is thin and crispy on the outside, while the filling is perfectly sweet, fragrant, and juicy. It’s a must-order!\n\nThe restaurant is only open in the mornings, and I recommend coming around 10 AM. If you arrive earlier, some items may not be ready yet.\n\nOverall, this place is a gem. I always come with my family, and it never disappoints. 🫶🏻"

I've been here a few times before for dim sum and birthday dinners but it was years ago. They have street metered parking (not much) or valet parking. The lot looked pretty crowded already but the restaurant still had seats. We had the classic dim sum staples (shrimp/beef churng fun, ha gow, shumai, pork ribs, chicken feet, taro puffs, sticky rice, tripe, meatballs, and fish balls). They were all pretty standard except the pork ribs, which had leftover pork taste so you're better off skipping that one. We also ordered beef chow fun and young chow fried rice. The chow fun was good, but I always love a chow fun.\n\nWe were seated on the platform area, so it was easy to be overlooked (i.e. in getting dim sum, flagging a waiter for water, the bill, etc.). Overall, it was your typical dim sum/Chinese restaurant experience - being ignored by waiters, and dishes that are hit or miss. But it definitely beats going into the heart of Flushing and having to fight for a spot (both parking and a table) there.\n\nTip - there's a weekday special where you can get medium and large dim sum plates for the price of a small plate."

The best was the shrimp hofan. I would not order the tripe again though since it was too tough. I would’ve added a star if the service had been more attentive. But overall it’s a nice place to enjoy quality dimsum on a lazy Sunday. After brunch you can do some Asian supermarket shopping in Yong Fa beside them."

I was told that my host booked a room that can accommodate 3 tables of 10 people per table so we can be seated comfortably.\n\nWhen we showed up, the restaurant made us sit in a room with 2 tables,  and 14 guests per table.\n\nThe food came all at once and before dessert was even served, the waiter shoved the bill to the host and began clearing the table with people still eating.\n\nAs it was a birthday banquet, guests were taking pictures and the restaurant staffers yelled at us to stop, get out of the room as they were seating the next dining party.\n\nI was taken here again on Mid Autumn Festival (Sep 10) and this time the restaurant made me wait for one hour before being seated despite after we made a reservation with a credit card deposit of $200.\n\nWe ordered off the menu (instead of having a more expensive customized menu) and the dishes were much smaller and the quality was actually quite mediocre.\n\nAs it was Mid Autumn Festival, we added a live fish for steaming and that's when the fun began. The fish were taken from the tank, weighted, tagged with a table number and the price put on to our bill. The live fish cost $40/lbs, and at 2 lbs 4 oz and cost us $90.\n\nAs the ordered food arrived and were literally thrown onto the table (as if we are dogs), we saw our fish being served to patrons that we think comes often (we saw the tag). We complained for 45 minutes and we were cursed at by the well trained staff,  told to shut up and not to cause any trouble...And finally a tiny fish showed up (see picture). And they rapidly served dessert of sweet soup, low quality mooncakes, and cut fruit, and handed me the bill. THEY DEMANDED THAT WE PAID IN CASH. The bill was $750.\n\nWhen I put the minimum gratuity of 15% after what they have done, they chased after us and ask the valet not to give us our cars unless we pay a minimum of 25% gratuity.\n\nTHIS RESTAURANT IS A FRAUD RUN BY THUGS, AND PROBABLY PATRONIZE BY SIMILAR TYPES....\n\nThere are much better restaurants with better food, decor, environment and SERVICE in Flushing (Grand，Congee Village, Golden Palace，Dong Yue and etc)\n\nSTAY FAR, FAR, FAR AWAY....RUN!"
