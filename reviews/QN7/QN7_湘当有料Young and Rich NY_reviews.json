            "text": "Hunan restaurants in NYC are harder to find than a Republican at Burning Man, so when I came across Young and Rich as a lunch contender, I was skeptical there'd actually be authentic (and good) Hunan dishes. But there were, and I was more than happy to be wrong.\n\nThe black Fried Stinky Tofu was delightfully musky and pungent, though nowhere near as stinky as its Taiwanese cousin (as is typical). Definitely get this for dining mates who've always wanted to try stinky tofu but need a \"training wheels\" version to start.\n\nThe Sauteed Prawns with Garlic and Vermicelli were gloriously crunchy and juicy, while the Griddle Spicy Bullfrog Pot was classic Hunan in a stew--from the chewy frog meat to the delicious green peppers. Similarly, the Stir-Fried Beef Hunan Style hit all the right regional notes. And the House Special Fish Head with Hunan Pepper--while taking an extra 45 min to prepare--was worth the wait for the mouth-tender fish and delicate spice, so similar yet so different from its bombastic Sichuan cousin.\n\nService was pretty easy and attentive throughout, and the decor was modern and clean."

I came early in the morning hoping for authentic Hunan flavors, but the spicy beef tasted just okay and felt like it had been premade. The seasoning seemed overly processed, with a chemical aftertaste that wasn’t very pleasant on the palate or the stomach. While it wasn’t terrible, it definitely didn’t deliver the fresh, bold flavors I was hoping for."
