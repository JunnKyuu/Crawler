Their 3 menu options are reasonably priced when compared to the other hyped AYCE Wagyu hot pot places in the area. We opted for the “VIP” menu ($36.95) which includes a good variety of meats, although the “House Special” menu ($24.95) would do just fine. The buffet section has all of the basics you would expect as well as a few uncommon choices. Service was friendly and efficient."

It’s always been reliable, not the best choice, but something you can count on when you don’t know what to eat."

If you like spicy, I'm sure you will enjoy this.\n\nI felt rushed with the 90 minute limit and afraid that if I did not like some food I was trying out, I would get charged the $35 fee.

Fine service, waitresses always look out for customers and give great services though the restaurant busy. They have 3 packages All You Can Eat: Value, House Special & Premium. I always pick House Special AYCE, best deal! For weekdays lunch $24.95, dinner $26.95 and weekends $28.95. Has a very clean family restroom and designated parking space a block away.

Even when the  place is crowded, they routinely come by to refill the hotpot. The buffet have a self-service table where you can get seafood, pasta, vegetables, and other side dishes. The meat were filling and tasty. The only thing you need to watch out is the timing. While they do not specify a time limit, you generally have between 2-2.5 hours as a time limit. Other AYCE places may extend to 3 hours, but here is slightly shorter. Still highly recommend as the foods and services were all great!"
