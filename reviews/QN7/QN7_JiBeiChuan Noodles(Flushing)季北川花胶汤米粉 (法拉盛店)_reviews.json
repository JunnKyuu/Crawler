I always get the bone soup rice noodles and it hits the spot especially now that the weather is getting cooler.\nI usually order for pickup and they package it really well. The noodles and soup are packed separately so the noodles don’t get soggy. The price point is great and the portion is big. I usually save the other half for later. Super satisfying every time.\nWill definitely come to dine in next time!"

They seated me quickly, and the portions were huge — one dish is definitely enough for two people.\n\nI ordered a tomato noodle soup, but I found it had way too many noodles and not enough vegetables or meat. Also, since most of the broths are pork-based, there aren’t many options if you don’t eat pork. I also tried the mushroom (wood ear) salad, which was fresh and delicious.\n\nIn short: the food is good and flavorful, but I’d love to see more balance with the soup (less noodles, more veggies and meat) and a few more non-pork soup options on the menu"

Like a slow burn but not too much to make it unenjoyable 🌶️ It was the perfect amount of spice and sour and I was in loveeee. If you’re a Tom Yum enjoyer, this is a MUST ORDER! I believe you can pick seafood or beef, but it also had tofu skin, fungus, enoki mushrooms, (another white mushroom I forgot the name of 😭), tomatoes, cabbage, quail egg, so much yummy stuff!\nAll my friends also enjoyed their meals except the friend who got the mala which was too spicy for them, but it still looked delicious!\nI also liked that they hand you a tablet to order so there’s no need to stress and rush, just add what you want to cart and give it back to the servers!\nThe food came out fast and the portions were amazing for the price! I have another whole meal after eating as much as I could for only $16! The servers were friendly and packed our meals togo for us! 🥹\nThere was also a promotion when we came in for buy 4 meals get 1 free so that was a pleasant surprise!\nI’ll definately need to stop by again whenever I’m craving Tom Yum 🤤"

You’ll find this near the Tangram mall.\n\nI’ve been struggling to find a good noodle place that had /actual/ flavor and used not old-ish meat. So I was relieved to find this place. The portion size can be split generously within two people and even three if you order something with broth or soup. Do note though that the flavors are there & good but not strong. However, you can definitely change that with special instructions.\n\nStaff was accommodating and patient. Place was not that big and would most likely have you waiting if it’s the lunch/dinner rush. But well-maintained.\n\nCan’t wait to try the cold chicken slices and other appetizers."

The soup base was tasty and not salty at all. The food portion was generous and we were filled and had a good amount of left over to pack up.  The only problem was the service. We sat down, placed our orders, received our orders, but we did not even offer hot tea or cold water. The waitress did not show up to check in with us at all during our meal. Other than the services, this was an enjoyable experience and the food was good."

Chicken was delicious.\nBUT…\nThe staff was rude with us.\nWe arrived at the shop 9:50 pm\nThe didn’t tell us that they are closing 10:20-10:30.\nWe ordered 4 plates for 2 people so we needed time to eat them.\nThey gave us the food quickly.\n\nThe guy that work there first he closes the one light behind us.\nThen he closes the music.\nIn the end he asked as for tips in cash. I am a tourist so I don’t have much cash with me in my last day there.\n\nI do not recommend it."

Their noodles are perfectly chewy, soaking up rich, flavorful broths like the deeply comforting beef noodle soup or the bold, spicy lamb. If you prefer something dry, the chili oil noodles pack a smoky, addictive punch. The space is small and no-frills, but the quick service and incredible flavors make it well worth a visit. For an affordable, satisfying bowl of noodles, Jibienchaun delivers every time."
