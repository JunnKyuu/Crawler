A delight to the palate and you felt like part of the family with the personable and exceptional service.  Thank you Antonio and friends! Rachel, Jerry and family!"

Their cocktails are excellent. I tried the bacio blu and bombay crush both are refreshing!\n\nThe staff are friendly and attentive. Look for Antonio when you visit.\n\nI’ve had their food before and really enjoyed it. Excited to come back soon for dinner 🍝"

Looking for a local breakfast place I found this unassuming little spot tucked in the back of a hotel.\n\nThe staff greeted me warmly and I was quickly seated.  They had quite a few food options including a huge breakfast buffet, but I chose the simple and less expensive American Breakfast.\n\nThe coffee was very good.  The food came out quickly and it was tasty. The eggs were prepared as I requested. The staff was attentive and kept my coffee cup full.\n\nThe place is very nice although it does not look like much from the street.  I was pleased with the simple and not too expensive breakfast options."

I’m very honestly surprised to see a restaurant like this exist in the middle of flushing, but as a local, you won’t hear any complaints from me.  The fact that people don’t frequent this restaurant enough for them to open regular hours is a crime.  I for one am sick of the monotonous greasy cheap Chinese food that’s everywhere in Flushing.  Every place claims to transport you back to China with their flavors…but if you want to know what Sicily tastes like, this is the spot to go to."

            "text": "As new residents in Flushing, one Friday evening my partner and I decided to explore local eateries in the area and we came across a hidden gem – Magna Italian Restaurant – located on Farrington Street, off Northern Boulevard.  (There is also a large sign on two sides of a building on Northern Boulevard which one cannot miss.)\n\nUpon arrival, we were cordially greeted by Barbara whose family, I believe, has owned the restaurant for many years and launched a successful comeback after overcoming the challenges of the Covid pandemic.  Barbara was extremely kind and immediately made us feel at home.  At that point, we knew we were in the right place as most of the restaurant was full, the guests enjoying their respective meals against the backdrop of a simple but charming room, accompanied by the sounds of good ole Italian favorites like Sinatra, Jerry Vale, and Gianni Morandi.\n\nMagna’s appetizer and main dishes were fresh, heavenly to ingest and appealing to all humanly senses.  The meals were served immediately and gracefully.\n\nWe spent approximately 90 minutes enjoying Magna and towards the end of the evening were engaged speaking with other patrons, sharing food, cooking, and traveling experiences with guests – some who were visiting from out of town.  Magna enjoys a constant flow of guests staying at the many nearly hotels and/or spending a layover from connecting flights leaving from LaGuardia Airport.\n\nWe encourage anyone seeking a delicious, traditional, family-style Italian meal to visit Magna.   The only regret is the restaurant is opened only from Thursday to Sunday.  Parking in the area is ample and neighborhood along Northern Boulevard is walkable and nearby the dynamic Flushing Chinatown (which is just across Northern Boulevard.)\n\nWe will definitely revisit and spread to good word among our friends and new neighbors.\n\nThank you, Magna, Barbara, and Team.\nBest,\nRicardo.\n\nP.S.\nBarbara, I am ready for my next Italian lesson."

Das Ambiente und die Begrüßung waren authentisch italienisch und wir als große Italienliebhaber haben uns darüber sehr gefreut. Die Einrichtung wirkte liebevoll dekoriert und auch die Musik im Hintergrund war italienisch.\nDie Bedienung (selbst aus Milano stammend, wie sie uns auf Nachfrage erzählte) war sehr herzlich und aufmerksam. Als Vorspeise hatten wir jeweils den Spinatsalat mit Tomaten und fritiertem Bacon und Organic Salat mit roten Zwiebeln. Beide waren frisch zubereitet. Der Bacon zum Spinat war eine sehr tolle Kombi.\nAls Hauptgang hatten wir Spaghetti mit Fleischbällchen und Hähnchen mit Spaghettiund Tomatensauce. Dazu wurde uns der Parmesan frisch auf den Teller gerieben.  Auch dieses Essen war wirklich sehr köstlich. Die Tomatensauce schmeckte auf jeden Fall frisch selbst gemacht.\nEs war einfach zu viel für mich, ich hab es nicht geschafft. Ich wollte ja noch ein Dessert.\nVorher gab es noch ein Limoncello aufs Haus und dazu einen Espresso aus der Siebträger. Sehr gut.\nAls Dessert gab es eine Kugel Vanilleeis und ein phantastisches Tiramisu,dekoriert mit Erdbeeren, Brombeeren und Schlagsahne. Ebenfalls sehr köstlich.\nWir haben uns rundherum wohl gefühlt. Bier gab es typisch italienisches.\nLeider leider und das ist wirklich der einzige Minuspunkt, der Wein (Chianti) hat leider gar nicht geschmeckt. Da hatte ich für ein italienisches Restaurant auf mehr gehofft.\nAnsonsten ein sehr toller Abend in toller Atmosphäre.\n\nAlles Liebe für euch"

            "text": "I'm in the bridal party for my friend's upcoming wedding and we decided to host her bridal shower at Magna. Originally, they promised us the back nook, so that it was semi private. It didn't work out and they gave us a large table on the side, which worked out. They pretty much let us use half the restaurant, set up a separate table for us to place the cake/cupcakes/guestbook (note - $3 plating fee per person if you bring your own cake), and even helped us hang our decorations (shout out to Fabio!) We decided to order a few dishes and serve it family style. Everything was great. This is what we had:\n\nCaesar Salad (romaine lettuce, croutons, reggiano cheese with classic Caesar dressing)\n\nCalamari Fritti (crisp fried calamari with garlic marinara sauce) - perfectly fried\n\nSfizi all'Italiana (freshly sliced prosciutto, mortadella, capicola, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, provolone, roasted peppers) - my only complaint was that there was no prosciutto (like the menu had described), but overall not bad.\n\nRigatoni alla Vodka (rigatoni pasta in pink vodka sauce) - this was my fave. I love a good pasta a la vodka.\n\nSpaghetti alla Carbonara (spaghetti with italian bacon, parmesan, and poached eggs) - this was pretty good too but also a bit heavy\n\nRisotto ai Frutti di Mare (risotto served with clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp) - they gave a good amount of seafood\n\nPollo alla parmigiana (breaded chicken breast topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella) - chicken was cooked perfectly\n\nFor drinks, we had asked about bringing our own bottles of wine but then they wanted to charge us a ridiculous corkage fee of $35 per bottle. We ended up just ordering four bottles of wine (for 14 people) for the table, which was the perfect amount. It was also cheaper than paying the corkage fee.\n\nOverall, it was a nice space for a bridal shower (also because no one was really there while our party was going on). However, I'd only recommend it if you have a small group. The restaurant isn't that big."

            "text": "I went with my friends and I to Magna for a little birthday lunch and it was pretty darn good! Tucked away in Flushing where you can mostly only find Chinese, Korean or Japanese cuisine, it's refreshing to see an Italian restaurant not too far from downtown Flushing. We got there around noon on a Sunday and the place was empty. We quickly ordered and while it took a while for the food to arrive, it was well worth the wait. There are enough vegetarian options for anyone in you're party and they also have a lunch special (3 courses - appetizer, entree and dessert). The entree portion sizes are huge and the only issue we all had with food itself was that the pasta sause was really sweet. We shared a Tiramisu for dessert and it that to was delicious! All in all, if you're looking for Italian food in Flushing, definitely check out this place!"

Our waiter Fabio was truly Itslian.  He was from the lake como and Cicely area.  The whole family seemed to be at the restaurant tonight.  Food qas great. We had Vitello alla Bolognese, Veal scaloppini with prosciutto and fontina cheese served in a white wine sauce and a special includomg chicken stuffes with mushrooma and fontina with a marsala sauce.  We had to.get the chocolate torte with some vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries and blueberries."

DO NOT GO\nPOOR SERVICE, FROZEN FOOD, OVERPRICED, FORCED 25% TIP.\n\nIn a Cold Sunday night I went for dinner; my bread was served cold, and fried calamari came with can tomato metal taste sauce. My waiter did not know how to open a bottle of wine.\n\nNevertheless; I decided to stay and went for steak and my friend order risotto. Well my steak arrived cold and overcooked,I could feel pieces of ice in my palate; I was starving which I did not have time to complain about it. Then my friend’s risotto arrived in a meager monkey dish piled up and overcooking the bottom portion.\n\nTo top it all off we ordered an apple pie Alamode, wich they ran out and had to fetch from Macdonalds; finally our microwaved apple pie came after a good 20 minutes; by then we had lost our appetite and ask for the bill. Shockingly there was a $25 force on the bill. 20% totaling $164.96\n\nI paid them and instead of complaining I wrote this review for Pple not to come here."

That was kinda ok so we were called to the table at 7:10 and nobody showed up to give water or anything for another 30 minutes. So finally after calling the waiter few times they came to take orders. Two of our guests ordered salmon dish, which after 25 tp 30 more minutes someone showed up at the table stating they ran out of salmon and can do white fish ( totaly different dish). At last our food was served arround 8:30\nFood is ok service is horrible."
