            "text": "Great place if you're looking for a nice meal and service that excels.  Host and hostess are constantly making sure you feel welcomed even on the extremely busy night we went. Waiting area had some table games to keep you busy as well as lemon water, tea and some light snacks like candy and pretzals. They told us that wait time was about 45 min, but we got our table within 20 min.\n\nOnce seated, the food selection was super fresh.  Ordering was done through an iPad at the table but if you need help, a waiter is on hand to explain the types of food and drinks and answer any questions you may have.  Everything was out in a flash.  They charge you $2.99 per person to use the sauce bar, I would recommend if you've never been to a hotpot place but if you have, you can skip it, unless you want unlimited soft serve and extra crackers, which are included with the sauce bar.  The soup base was the most flavorful we have ever tried.  My wife had the bone broth with mushrooms and I had the tomato.  Did not need any dipping sauce with these two soup bases.  All in all, excellent food that you won't normally find at a standard hotpot place.  We had two types of Wagyu, shrimp, razor clams, crispy tofu skin and some veggies.  You can order hand pulled noodles as well as ramen and upon but we were stuffed.  I would definitely recommend.  Try reserving ahead of time because they are always busy."

The staff is very attentive, making sure everyone feels taken care of, especially kids—they even bring small toys and kid-friendly meals, which is nice. It can be a bit tough to find the entrance, but once inside, the space is big and there’s seating while you wait. The $19.99 lunch combo has a good mix of proteins, veggies, and soup options, and it’s pretty filling with all the sides like crackers and dessert. Overall, it’s worth a visit, though making a reservation is recommended."

Fresh ingredients and delicious soup bases.\n\nYou can actually choose four soup bases, which is a great option if you couldn’t decide what to choose from. Of course you need to pay more.\n\nThe price is a little bit high relatively, but I guess we pay all the complimentary service and goodies, like hand message service, iPhone screen protector service, free ice cream and fruits, crackers, candies and drinks etc.\n\nWaiting area is a good place to relax.

We two people spent $170 including tips and taxes. I don’t think the restaurant worths the money. Seriously, better save money for omakase sushi.\n\n가성비 ㅆ똥망. 우선 개시끄러움. 도떼기시장임. 쓸데 없이 유명만 함. 재료가 특출 난 것도 아니고 월마트에서 1.5불하는 샐러드 가지고 와서 12불 받음(베이비당근이랑 브로컬리ㅋㅋ). 28불 하는 와규는 지방만 개많음 걍 쓰레기임. 무엇보다 훠궈에 안어울림. 단언컨대 정상인이면 두 번은 안 감."

The store itself is quite spacious, with over 100 tables for people to sit at, and does get filled quite quickly. They offer private rooms as well as larger tables for larger parties.\n\nThe service is exceptional. The waiter and staff checked in on us nearly every second, offering us free goodies (that you need a secret code to get), as well as telling us about the many offerings they have.\n\nThe food, although on the pricier side, was of good quality and tasted great. We got the tom yum broth as well as the tomato broth. The tom yum broth was a bit too sour for our liking, but the tomato broth was amazing. The dancing noodle was nice and chewy, and they put on a show when they make it which was fun to watch. The rest of the products were typical hotpot offerings, but were of top quality and tasted great in the broth."

            "text": "I went there to celebrate my relative’s birthday and it was a great experience, we bought a birthday cake from another store and brought it there and when we finished eating they brought it up along with a speaker playing happy birthday song with a person holding a happy birthday sign. We spent almost $400 including tips which was a bit expensive as I didn’t think we ordered that much but the service was amazing. Food was not bad, it’s just like normal hot pot but there was also free snacks and sauces at the booth which for us had watermelon, chicken nuggets and bean sprouts but I went there before and it varies depending on the seasons and when you go. The service was amazing, there was a waitress there who was almost always there at standby, she helped remove the trash and was always ready to help refill our water. I also tried this secret code I saw online which was to tell the waiter “小仙女来吃火锅了” (Little fairy is here for hot pot) which I think got us the small fairy wand. The other toys were probably given cause we had a lot of kids on the table, they also provided a free kids meal since we had a very little kid. There was also a performance which was really enjoyable to watch, it lasted about 5 minutes not sure when it happens but we went around 7-8pm."

Also the bathrooms have complimentary cologne (if you ask), hair spray, toothbrush, razor, and floss, even mouthwash. The complimentary snacks, chicken nuggets, and boba is good too. Overall a really delicious spot for dinner."

As soon as we got there, the staff asked if I was scared of dogs (there was one nearby), which I really appreciated because I actually am and they immediately helped us switch to another table. Super thoughtful, I’ve never had that happen anywhere else. Service throughout the night was amazing. They paid attention to everyone at the table and made us feel really taken care of. We brought our own birthday cake and they offered to keep it in their fridge, then later came out singing happy birthday and even gave us free ice cream. So sweet! Food was delicious as always. Definitely coming back!!!!"

Waiting time can be very long like hours but they provided lounge with snacks and games. Service was excellent. I wish they have more selection of meats. They also offer complimentary soft serve."

            "text": "感觉现在的海底捞服务真的不如以前了。以前服务员都会主动帮忙打汤，也会及时补充餐巾纸，但这次完全没有。菜品方面更让人失望，我们快吃完时，最后一块脆皖鱼下锅后，竟然在菜盘子里发现一根粗短的毛发。我当时提醒了服务员，问这是头发还是其他什么东西，结果他们什么处理都没有，只是把盘子收走了。因为已经吃到最后，也没办法多说什么，但说实话真的非常恶心。\n\nThe service at Haidilao isn’t as good as it used to be. In the past, staff would always help serve the soup and proactively refill napkins, but this time they didn’t. What’s worse, when we were almost done eating, after putting the last piece of crispy perch into the pot, we suddenly found a short thick hair in the dish. I pointed it out to the server and asked if it was hair or something else, but they didn’t handle it at all—just took the plate away. Since we were already at the end of the meal, we didn’t make a fuss, but honestly, it was really disgusting."
