It is expensive, but worth it if you can try it. The fish tacos had an interesting twist with the sauce, which might've been some sort of marinara. The burgers and steak were solid. The steak came out with a crust on the outer layer which was odd. The mashed potatoes with the steak was the highlight of my meal! It had some sort of caramel or truffle flavor, not really sure. Dessert wasn't anything to write home about. Overall a great experience, nice ambience, good food, interesting flavors, great service, but it comes at a pretty big cost."
