The portion was generous, with two sides and two rice included, making it a fantastic value. The tomato broth was rich and flavorful, and the combo of beef and fish was surprisingly perfect—hearty, fresh, and super satisfying. Every bite felt comforting and well-balanced. Definitely one of the best hot pot experiences we’ve had in a while. We’ll be back for sure!"

One thing the day I came here was the seating I were at there were no air conditioners not on. Especially, on a humidity day and eating spicy food (mild), if A/C were not on that's ridiculous. My wife and I were sweating seating there. Not sure if their A/C were malfunction or they don't want to turn it on because there are not much people in the store. But I felt like the that's not right. Summer day, no A/C, it's not worth to come.\nI recommend you guys bring an electric fan or regular fan to be use."

We got the classic spice with bean curd and king oyster mushrooms, chicken wings, and pork belly. We also got the tomato soup with fish and beef with lotus root and wide noodles plus milk custard and spicy noodles. Would come again!"

The fragrant rice was of the highest quality.\n\nBeers for $3.99 is fantastic value to off set the spicy flavor.\n\nVery comfortable leather lounge seats & vibes.\nAn enjoyable experience overall and highly recommended. 🙏🏻"

The small is good for 2 people. 3 people sharing it is kind of a stretch. Would recommend, especially during cold winter nights. Their TO GO container is sealed and spill proof! The container is a aluminum bowl, and the top is hot sealed aluminum cover (like how they seal bubble teas). Then it is placed on a cardboard platform with strings so it is always leveled when you carry it."

The side dishes were also amazing, especially the chicken feet and the spicy chicken dish, both of which were packed with flavor.\n\nThe service was exceptional as well. Our server was very attentive, constantly refilling our water and making sure we had everything we needed. The air conditioning was strong, which was a great relief on a hot day.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful meal, and I will definitely be coming back!"

Savory and sour- you just have to try it for yourself. We also got cucumber salad and fried pork belly as the sides. Fried pork belly was 10/10 but I would say the cucumber salad was very average. Atmosphere is great, food great\n\nHowever, service not the best. Took 10 minutes of constantly trying to get the server’s attention just for the check."

We got the original soup base + spam + king oyster mushroom and for the sides the chicken in spicy sauce and the spicy fern noodles.\n\nThe soup was perfect, there was a good amount of beef and fish which is def a plus when you’re eating with your bf that only likes protein. The soup base was a great blend of sour and spicy. I personally can’t eat toooo much spice so I really liked that. (They do have a spicer option too)\n\nIn terms of the sides, I loveeedd the chicken. I always get steamed chicken in spicy sauce in every Szechuan restaurant I go to. (In search for one similar to my favorite restaurant that has now closed down). The one here was the closest I’ve ever gotten, will def be back just for this side tbh.\n\nThe spicy fern noodle was good, but not my fav personally.\n\nLastly the milk mochi is sooo good and refreshing after the meal.\n\nThe service was also a 10/10, super attentive and very quick.\n\nOverall, loved everything about this restaurant!\n\nPS peep how cute the togo packaging is for the sauerkraut soup."

The food was not even prepared by the time my uber eats cyclist got to the restaurant. They proceeded to make him wait 10 more minutes. Fine, that happens, no biggie.\n\nI finally got the food delivered but as you can see from the picture, the “small pot” order, which is supposed to be 1lbs was not even close, barely took up half of the container. This is barely even half of the dine-in amount. The taste was also not even half as good as the dine in experience. I will definitely not be ordering out from here again."
