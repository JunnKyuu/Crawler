When the previous table of guests leaves, the guests just put the plate aside and don’t use the plate. The service staff will not replace it with a new one and save it for the next table of guests.

Those that eat ramen and those that eat Top Ramen.\n\nIf youre an avid ramen enthusiast and go out of their way to find a good bowl of ramen, this is worth a skip. As I believe you will not be impressed.  If this is your first time trying something outside of a package or you are trying to introduce your friends to ramen, this place is worth trying.\n\nThere are a number of locations around New York City, this particular one in Flushing is a bit tucked away. They have very attractive combo sets and enough of a selection (even vegetarian) that there will be something for everyone. Excluding their vegetarian ramen, they serve Tonkotsu and Shoyu broths with variations that include spicy miso. Their noodles are wavy instead of straight so if you like that little extra bounce with your noodles it is a plus.\n\nThey have a reward system where at the bottom of the bowl (once you finish your soup) you can be rewarded with either a free drink, popcorn chicken, dessert, and one other (i forgot) on your next visit. I think it is a rather fun and clever way to make sure you return!"

We pressed the bell and nobody came. 30min later, out of the blue, a waiter shows up and yells: what do you want?\nVery rude. Then we were ready to leave so we pressed the bell to get the bill. Nobody. We pressed a second time and still nobody. I had to go see someone at the counter for someone to come. Really not impressed with this place."

When he finally came to get our orders he didn’t even confirm anything we were saying about our orders or even say “are you ready to take your orders?”. On top of all of this it took him forever simply to bring me a glass of water, didn’t get my dessert with my omurice and a HAIR strand was in my gfs ramen.

The Purple Sweet Potato Fries with spicy mayo were a unique and delicious starter, the Chilled Tofu had an authentic Japanese street-food feel, and the Salt & Pepper Crispy Corn was a bold, unexpected twist.\n\nThe ambiance was just as inviting, with traditional Japanese decor that made it feel like a cozy ramen shop in Ginza or Osaka. The only downside was the service, which was inattentive and not very knowledgeable. However, the outstanding food and atmosphere more than made up for it."

Truly when it comes for a good food trip NYC is one of the best to go.\n\nIt’s just the service extremely sucks as well. That’s why I gave 3star rating. For how good the food was, the service was the total opposites. Server seems doesn’t seem like what his doing, don’t care about his customers and not courteous nor polite. When you ask a questions it seems like his too bothered to even answer.\n\nI really don’t want to even leave a tip, I just did because of the great food. I wish I can choose where my tip will go, for kitchen staff.\n\nOverall still recommended because the food was really delicious. Just do not expect anything with their customer service it was so outrageous."

Since they are a child it was the perfect portion for them.\nAs far as service is concerned, the waiter was very nice and got whatever we needed quickly.

The noodles had good flavor, especially the spicy Miso Ramen. If you are not a fan of spicy food, do not worry since the spice level can be adjusted.

The interior design is definitely captivating when you first walk in. The wooden aesthetic is different. The stairs that lead up to the dining area are kinda steep. The upstairs dining area has a decent amount of tables and are spaced out. The first floor has a bar btw. The waiters/waitresses are very polite and attentive. They make sure your glass is full of water and that you don't have empty plates or bowls on your table for too long. I wanted to try new menu items; he lobster chashu balls were an acquired taste. I feel like they tasted good, just for me personally I had just the one and that was enough. My boyfriend had the chicken ramen, popcorn chicken and gyoza, he really enjoyed the gyoza and the popcorn chicken especially. He enjoyed the ramen noodles themselves. I had the ying-yang bowl which was new, a taste of tonkatsu and miso. I preferred the tonkatsu side, but both broths had their own distinguished flavors. The noodles were nice and chewy and the additives were a nice temperature. Overall, I may not have finished everything, but I'm very certain that others with a different palate from mine would enjoy every bite. I still enjoyed my time here and I look forward to trying other locations."

The atmosphere was pleasant, and the delicious aroma heightened my anticipation. However, from the moment I sat down, my excitement turned into disappointment.\n\nThe servers guided me to the second floor and left me unattended for 15 minutes. It wasn’t until much later that they took my order, and even then, water was never served until after my food arrived.\n\nThe plating of the pork cutlet omelette was unremarkable. The servers couldn’t even cut the omelette properly, so it spilled over the side. Is it the standard here to plate the pork cutlet on the side and pour the sauce on it instead of placing it on top of the omelette? That’s fine, I suppose. But the fried rice inside the omelette was cold and greasy, and it was so overly salty that it was inedible unless eaten with the egg. The pork cutlet wasn’t fried properly, leaving me with a raw batter-like texture.\n\nI won’t be coming back. Even after finishing my meal, I was left without service for another 20 minutes, and I still never received water. Please train your servers properly. It felt like no effort was made. They don’t even seem to know what they’re supposed to be serving. Do not go here—it’ll only ruin your meal."
