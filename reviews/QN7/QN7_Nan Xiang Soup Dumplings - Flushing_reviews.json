The soup dumplings are good, definitely a viable option if you're in the area. Pan fried buns were also good, but best eaten on the spot since the fried bottoms will soften up over time. I can't say I was blown away by their offerings but I did appreciate the accessibility (parking may be difficult though since this is at the corner of a generally busy intersection) and how they also open late"

            "text": "This is one of the well-known dumpling chain restaurants in New York City, and we visited the Flushing location. There was no line when we arrived, so we were seated right away. However, the place was almost packed. It was late in the afternoon — not quite lunch or dinner — but we were craving dumplings and decided to give it a try.\n\nThey served complimentary hot tea, which was perfect on a chilly day. It tasted wonderful, and the staff happily refilled it throughout our meal. We ordered two types of dumplings: one green-tinted variety (likely pork with leek or herbs) and a set of chicken soup dumplings. The pork dumplings were outstanding — flavorful and aromatic — while the chicken ones were milder in taste.\n\nThe service was attentive; they brought out the dumplings in batches so each set stayed piping hot. The soup dumplings in particular were excellent — steamy, juicy, and comforting. They also had chili oil on the table, which added a perfect kick.\n\nOverall, this place is a great spot for dumpling lovers — flavorful food, warm service, and a cozy vibe. Highly recommended if you’re in the Flushing area."

Several of their signature dishes that I also recommend are Beef Tripe in Spicy Sauce, Four Happiness Sponge Tofu, and Shanghai Stir-Fried Udon. If you want more beef and bok choy, then go for the Beef Stir-Fried Udon instead of the Shanghai Stir-Fried Udon. Other than that, enjoy!"

Prices and value and service are all exceptional, as is the food.\n\nThe space is quite inviting and has a warm comfortable and clean feel.  The most bizarre yet hilarious thing is the background music was on a ~30 second loop, but it was very peaceful and quiet so didn’t much matter.\n\nThe service was so friendly and prompt despite the place being slammed on a Saturday afternoon. The staff were running about and quickly tending to everyone at such a pace that I myself could not sustain. Despite this they were extremely friendly and helpful. They not only brought us the to-go containers, but expertly packed them up, which can be tricky with some soups.\n\nThe food…\n\nWonton soup: incredible! The broth was light and refreshing, very authentic. The wontons were so tender and savory. The best part? It was like $9 or something. It could have been a full meal.\n\nSoup Dumplings: incredible! We had 2 orders. The pork and crab meat, and the mixed. They are again savory and tender, but satisfyingly subtle and packed with a yummy broth.\n\nWe also had the woodear mushrooms and chicken soup, which were equally incredible! We couldn’t even finish these because the portion sizes of the wonton soup and dumplings were so large.\n\nI dream of this."

I guess they tried to save time but this is going to be problem for some customers if changes are not allowed? Food is fine but the best dish is the pan fried noodle with seafood on top! Soup Dumpling is just OK, too bad we had people never have soup dumplings before to try, I guess that's their first and last time."

At 10am on Saturday morning, no line and good amount of empty tables.\n\nThe 生煎包/pan-fried pork buns were ok, I really like the taste of the dough. The meat itself was ok, it was slightly firm, and slightly sweet. There was juice sitting in a pool in the bun itself, but I felt like the meat itself was not that juicy.\n\nThe standard 小笼包/xiaolongbao was good; it had good flavor, but I wish the meat was more fragrant and more tender. I think the meat here was more juicier than the panfried buns, but still not fatty and melt in your mouth like some other ones that I’ve had.\n\nWe also got the 咸豆腐脑/savory tofu pudding, and I felt like it was bland. I wish there was more 榨菜/pickled vegetables in it, but at least there was chili oil and soy sauce/vinegar on the table to customize to your liking.\n\nAll in all, pretty good, but maybe not mind-blowing for someone traveling a long-distance specifically for this. But if I lived nearby, I’d probably come for breakfast/lunch often, due to it being a cozy spot."
