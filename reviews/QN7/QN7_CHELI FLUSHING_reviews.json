You do need to flag them down if you need anything, like a traditional Chinese restaurant, but they are super responsive, and always replenishing the table with napkins, which my parents loved 😂. They were also very kind to ask my father again whether the food was suitable for him since he has a hard time chewing chewier things. So kind of them to remember that and show concern."

            "text": "As excited as we were for this food, it just didn’t live up.\nFor starters, I did enjoy the soup dumplings (we did regular pork xlb, but also got the pork/truffle xlb). The skin of the dumpling was thin and sturdy so it made for a good soupy bite.  You order via an iPad, so there isn’t much human interaction but I was able to add their beggars chicken to my order however when time came to place the order, we were told they were sold out.  It wasn’t clear that there’s limited quantities, and by the time someone physically came to our table they said they’re sold out but another batch would be ready, one server quoted us 40 mins, another said over an hour. So that was disappointing 😳\nNext, there’s no rhyme or reason to how the food is brought out. Our fried rice came out before any of the entrees, which was then followed by soup but no bowls were given at the table-we had to ask multiple different servers.  The soup was phenomenal though, it was a beef in golden broth soup. After the fried rice was finished, we got our fish in sweet and sour glaze.  This wasn’t very appetizing at all, there’s so much sauce/glaze that you don’t even realize you’re eating fish. It was way too overpowering.  Then came our fried duck, which is meant to be eaten like Peking duck, but the duck itself was so hard and over done.  The beef ribs in pepper sauce were good, lacking flavor but compared to what we had until then it was ok. The poached shrimp was delicious, the shrimp was cooked perfectly.  Mind you, we had ordered some sides of white rice, which never came out until the end.\nI think our meal had potential to be better but just certain things need to be worked on. The restaurant wasn’t as chaotic/busy as other reviews have said it can be. There were many empty tables when we went so not sure where the breakdown in serving was?\niPads can be a good ordering tool but not a substitution. When we had asked for our white rice during our meal we kept being told it was coming out, but it wasn’t also like we had a dedicated person serving us, you had to try to flag someone down every single time and it was never the same person twice.  Like we’re getting our fried rice before we get the white rice that’s more than likely premade, and just needs to be plated and served?  It’s a moderately priced restaurant, but there’s definitely better ones in the area…"

The decor is unlike any other Chinese restaurant I’ve visited—rich in character, with thoughtful details that spark curiosity and admiration at every turn. The food? Absolutely delicious. Every dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor, from the delicate dim sum to the bold, savory entrées. You can tell the kitchen takes pride in both authenticity and creativity. Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive, striking the perfect balance between professionalism and warmth. It made the whole experience feel personal and welcoming.\nHighly recommend Cheli for anyone seeking a memorable dining experience that delights all the senses."

Definite orders should be the beef stir fry which stole our hearts and so did the truffle soup dumpling. The chicken in wine, eggplant, and braised pork belly with quail eggs blew our mind. The presentation of the beggars chicken was outstanding. The wait time on a Saturday afternoon was a bit long but the experience was worth the wait..if you're in flushing and you decide to go for a heart meal, this is the place for you."

We dine here once a week, and each time we’re reminded why we keep coming back. The food is consistently outstanding, the service is warm and attentive, and the experience is always memorable. Tonight, we celebrated the Mooncake Festival at Che Li, and it was nothing short of perfect.\n\nFirst, the food — and there’s so much to rave about.\n\nOur all-time favorite dish is the truffle soup dumpling. It’s luxurious and fragrant, with that incredible truffle aroma hitting you the moment it arrives. The dumpling skin is delicate, and the soup inside is rich and flavorful. It’s hands down one of the best soup dumplings we’ve had in the city — and a must-order every time.\n\nThe braised pork is another standout. It’s incredibly tender, with layers of flavor that melt in your mouth. The sauce is perfectly balanced — slightly sweet, savory, and so satisfying. It pairs beautifully with rice or noodles and has become our go-to comfort dish.\n\nWe also love the vegetarian duck, which is flavorful, crispy, and unbelievably satisfying — even for meat eaters. It’s one of those dishes that surprises people with how good vegetarian food can be. The texture is spot on, and the seasoning is rich without being heavy.\n\nTo celebrate the Mooncake Festival, Che Li gifted us a complimentary mooncake, which was such a thoughtful and festive touch. It was beautifully presented, not overly sweet, and the perfect way to honor the holiday. It felt very special to enjoy it in a place that clearly values tradition as much as flavor.\n\nWe also had their pan-fried pork buns, which were golden and crispy on the bottom, soft and fluffy on top, with juicy, flavorful pork inside. Another favorite — so comforting and expertly done.\n\nAnd then came a surprise highlight of the evening: the dessert pear. This was truly something special — lightly sweet, refreshing, and so delicately prepared. It wasn’t just a dessert — it was a beautiful palate cleanser and a perfect end to the meal. Elegant, subtle, and unforgettable.\n\nChe Li always delivers, but tonight reminded us just how much care they put into their food and hospitality. Even as regulars, we continue to be impressed — not only by the menu but by the experience. The restaurant itself has a stylish yet traditional atmosphere, and the staff always make us feel welcome.\n\nIf you’re looking for authentic, high-quality Chinese cuisine in Flushing — whether for a special occasion like the Mooncake Festival or just a weekly dinner you look forward to — Che Li is the place. We feel lucky to be regulars and can’t wait for next week’s dinner."

            "text": "I work nearby and used to come here. It was usually a good experience, so I decided to bring some guests on a Friday night. I called ahead to check if they had a table for five, and they said yes — they'd hold it for me. I walked over right away, got there in about five minutes, and was told someone already sitting in the restaurant took our table because they didn’t like theirs. Seriously?\n\nThey tried to squeeze us into a table for four and said they couldn’t add a chair because the next table was too close. It was way too tight for five people. I saw a bigger table that could fit us and asked if we could take it, but they said it was booked two weeks ago. I don’t get it — if our reserved table could be taken by someone else, why couldn’t we take a table that was also “booked”?\n\nI asked about the next available table, and the girl at the front said 25 minutes. I asked the guy next to her to double-check, and he didn’t even look — just said she already told us and there’s nothing he could do.\n\nI ended up leaving with my guests to find another place. It was embarrassing. I used to recommend this restaurant to coworkers, but after this mess, I won’t anymore. It’s a shame — one bad experience and poor service can really ruin a good spot."

Our waiter was super attentive and friendly.\n\nThe beggar's chicken and braised pork belly was extremely tender, melts in your mouth. The Kaofu was perfectly done, unlike many places where it's overwhelmed by a sugary sauce, here it was perfectly balanced and subtly sweet.  Also got the pumpkin with salted egg yolk based off another review and it delivered. Crispy, flavorful and smooth with no grainy texture.\n\nThe best part was I didn't feel extremely bloated after eating so much. Highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area."

For example, I don’t really like salted egg yolk breaded items because they can be pretty grainy and soggy but their salted egg yolk pumpkin was sooo good! The ambiance is great and the staff are polite and professional. Pricing is not bad at all compared to a lot of other restaurants in Flushing. Wait times can be a little longer especially during the weekends but I always stroll around the area so it never feels like I’m waiting too long."

The food here is exquisite and impressively presented especially their “beggar chicken” with flame and “clay like” wrapping. This is an ancient dish for the emperor in China The chicken inside was moist, soft and flavorful due to its slow cooking method. I also love their longing shrimp presentation with ice smoke coming out and it pairs really well with sake due to its subtle flavor.  I can’t wait to go back to Flushing location for another royal feast."
