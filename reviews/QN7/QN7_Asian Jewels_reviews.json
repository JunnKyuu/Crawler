Before we even sat down, the servers were already offering us plates—so be prepared to start eating right away!\n\nThe food itself was delicious and very unique for the american palate. My friends and I particularly liked the siu mai and cheong fun.  However the experience can feel overwhelming if you’re not familiar with dim sum.The dishes come around quickly, and it was sometimes hard to understand what the staff were saying due to both the noise level and a language barrier. Some of the items are pictured in the menu, and at the front of the restaurant there’s a complete list of items in both English and Chinese, which is really helpful.\n\nThe dim sum servers were friendly and never too pushy, which I appreciated. The only downside was trying to flag down a regular waiter for some water. When we finally did get someones attention he was a bit rude and told us to wait though no one brought us water until we asked a different waiter 15 minutes later.\n\nOverall, the food makes this place worth visiting. It’s delicious and authentic. Be ready for a fast-paced, lively atmosphere, and maybe brush up on dim sum basics beforehand to make the experience smoother."

In my last visit, the food was good as always (though some dishes could have been warmer) and the dim sum carts came around frequently with a good variety of food. What really stood out on this visit, though, was the super-attentive service.  We rarely ever had to wait for anything we needed which is a huge accomplishment for a large place that serves the amount of customers they get.  Not sure if the stars were aligned or if we just got lucky, but it was a great visit.  I am sure we will be back."

We were still able to get dim-sun but just had to order them specifically and wait longer. The dim-sun was pretty tasty, although I would have liked the pork buns more if they had more meat inside. The soup dumplings also didn’t have much soup insight which was a bit disappointing. The tripe was great though. We had a great time but I recommend coming before 3:30pm for the best experience."

We came on a packed weekend morning and got seated instantly. Within minutes, food was on the table.\n\nWe had all the staples—shumai, chicken feet, congee, fish balls, shrimp dumplings, milk buns. Everything was solid, nothing mind-blowing, but very true to the old-school experience. Service was efficient, no frills.\n\nThe space is huge and hectic, but that’s part of the charm. Price is totally reasonable—three people ate well for about $70 with tips. Not the best dim sum in town, but if you want that bustling, cart-pushing vibe without the wait, this spot delivers."

Taste are really good like the one I had in Hong Kong. Rice roll are tasty especially the fried Chinese dough are really good. They have their own parking lot for free.

They also have cart ladies pushing around the dishes, which is awesome to see since many dim sum spots I go to no longer do this.

It is also very popular, and as the area continues to develop, the restaurant has become even busier. To avoid long waits, I recommend going before 11 AM or between 2-3 PM to avoid peak times.\n\nThey offer dim sum with pushcart service, allowing you to choose your favorite dishes. Since the dim sum is made fresh, it's always delicious. Compared to many other dim sum places, most of their dishes are impeccable in both taste and presentation. In addition to dim sum, they also offer typical Cantonese stir-fry dishes and noodles. It's an excellent choice for dim sum."

Although some of the things are slight departures of the dishes you'd fine in Hong Kong, they're tasty nonetheless. Definitely one of the best dim sum spots in Flushing.
