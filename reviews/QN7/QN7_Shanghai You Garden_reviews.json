I had the complimentary soup dim sum after ordering chinese meatballs and shrimp in rice noodles. It was delicioulsy served steaming hot in Bamboo steam trays. Service was prompt, friendly, and accomodating. This cash only emporium is a must try if you puruse the samplings on 40th road in Flushing, China Town. Great eats, priced right!"

There's positive pandemic pricing where u get a basket of 6 Shanghai soup dumplings gratis if u spend over $10\n\nI went there again with my wife & a friend on 10/10/25. We had 1/2 of the Peking duck that came along with the 6 soup dumplings, gratis. We had this beef tripe dish, which I didn't lime too much. My friend order some savory soy soup. That was OK. The Shanghai chicken, which looks like Hainese chicken, doesn't taste as good as the latter. We also had shui Mai, which is not as tasty as some other dim sum places. For vegetables we had the pea sprouts. The best was the Peking duck & the soup dumplings.  For some reason the shredded cucumber they serve for the Peking duck doesn't look too fresh. It was translucent as if it was kept in the freezer for quite some times."

Shanghai You Garden might look like any ordinary Chinese restaurant from the outside, but it’s easily one of the most heartwarming dining experiences I’ve had in New York. The food quality is way above expectations, my scallion noodles even had shrimp the size of the ones you’d find back in Taiwan. I ordered just $12 worth of food (rice rolls and beef balls), and they surprised me with extra soup dumplings and sweet rice wine balls. In a city that can feel cold and rushed, this place served me genuine warmth and care. Truly a 5 star kind of comfort that makes you feel seen, full, and grateful."

There's something heartwarming and inspiring about walking into this huge restaurant early in the morning and seeing elderly Chinese couples sitting down and enjoying breakfast. You can grab their 2.75$ duck buns at the window takeout but I will offer you to step inside. They have a free set of dumplings 🥟 on each set you orders. We loved the duck 🦆 buns ( mine wasn’t the first time 😃🥰🤗) and the soup dumplings were delicious and so comforting. The staff is welcoming and friendly and the Tea they served as basic treat was good too. Don’t miss this place 😃😃"

After sitting down for a moment a man approached our table and told us the restaurant was closing at 9:30 because they needed to “clean” and that we should leave, don’t restaurants need to be cleaned EVERY night? If you want to close at 9:30 change the hours posted outside and on your website. I have eaten at this restaurant before but after my experience this time I won’t be returning."

Once we were almost done with a dish, the rest of what we ordered came out. It was a great experience. The only bummer is that it is cash only, but they have zelle and venmo options which helped. I'll definitely be going back with my family."

We also ordered half of a roasted duck which is enough meat to feed about 7 servings (several extra buns but not enough meat). CASH ONLY with an ATM on site. Their other dishes are also very yummy to try. They also gave us a FREE dessert soup - warm and sweet with small glutinous balls."

The prices are reasonable, the staff are friendly, and the menu offers a wide variety of choices. Sadly, I’ve noticed that the food quality has started to decline compared to past visits. The wonton and noodles, which used to be my go-to dishes, are no longer as flavorful or satisfying as they once were. I still enjoy coming here, but I really hope the kitchen returns to the high standard that made this place so special."

Keep this in mind if you're solo dining...\n\nThe scallion pancakes were delicious and the pork buns very good (not my fave in Flushing, but solid). The soup dumplings were good and the soymilk was the perfect amount of sweet.

Was a hidden gem, the front of the restaurant was completely empty, but bustling in the back. Food was great and reasonably priced. The soup dumplings were not as good as others I’ve had and would not order again as the filling and the soup lacked flavor. However, the duck was delicious (even though it didn’t have much meat), the spicy tripe and beef was tender and tasty, the fried scallion and shrimp dumplings  were delicious and would recommend. Our family of 4 ate for less than $85 all in (tax and tip). It’s cash only, btw!"

Yes! Absolutely free and tasty. When a friend had rhapsodized about the cuisine here, I made sure to venture to Queens and spend the day exploring and eating. This time I also ordered the Chive and Shrimp Pancake which was a tad greasy. With a crisp wrapper, it was toothsome and every bite made me joyous. Only the shrimp rice roll was disappointing as the wrapper was too thick. Service is efficient and unobtrusive. A clean restroom (washroom) is located in the back. During the summer months one can order these duck baos and sit outside in the front to enjoy it. There are countless restaurants in Flushing but Shanghai You Garden remains one of my favorites. This is a cash only restaurant and my bill is always inexpensive. What more can one ask for?"

Never misses.\n\n🍡 Glutinous Rice Cake\nChewy, lightly crisped, and just a hint of sweetness. A fun texture break between mains and dessert.\n\n🍮 Rice Pudding\nWarm, creamy, and not too sweet. The perfect soft landing after a savory feast. Hits the soul!\n\nFlushing does it again! Shanghai You Garden is a perfect place for some sit down Chinese favorites.

If you’re craving authentic Shanghainese food with affordable prices and fast service, this is the place to be.\n\nIf you’re a first timer, I highly recommend their xiao long bao, sheng jian bao, and shanghai pork mooncakes.\n\nOn our latest visit, we were genuinely impressed. The food and dining atmosphere felt even better than before.\n\n＊Crab Meat Soup Filled Bun 蟹粉灌湯包 $6.95\n＊Abalone and Crab Meat Soup Filled Bun 鮑魚蟹粉灌湯包 $8.95\nBasically, it’s a giant version of a regular soup dumpling. Guan tang bao (灌湯包) is hard to find because the making process is much more intricate. Be sure to use the straws they provide to sip the broth before digging in.\n\n＊Pan Fried Pork Bun 生煎包 $9.50 **\nA lovely crispy, golden bottom. My aunt thought it was a bit too burnt, but I loved the satisfying crunch. The bao was fluffy and packed with juicy pork filling. Definitely a must-try!\n\n＊Crab Meat & Pork Soup Dumpling 蟹粉小籠包 $10.95 *\n＊Pork Soup Dumpling 鮮肉小籠包 (free) *\nPossibly the juiciest xiao long bao I’ve ever had! I’m amazed at how they pack so much broth inside without the wrapper feeling too thick.\n\n＊Pork Mooncake 月餅 $3/pc **\nLast Mid-Autumn Festival, I made a special trip to Flushing just to get their mooncakes. Unlike Cantonese mooncakes filled with lotus paste and egg yolk, Shanghainese mooncakes have a flaky pastry and savory filling.\n\n＊Red Bean Rice Cake 條頭糕 $1.95/pc\n＊Purple Sweet Potato Mochi w. Salted Egg Lava 紫薯流沙團 $4/pc\nWe tried two of their mochi desserts, which were served warm and wrapped in plastic to keep them from drying out. Both were enjoyable, especially if you’re into snacks that aren’t too sweet.\n\n＊Fermented Glutinous Rice Dumpling $7.95\nEvery time, we’re treated to their 酒釀圓子. While they taste just okay, I can’t say no to freebies.\n\n＊Fried Bean Gluten 上海烤麩 $10.95 **\n＊Sweet and Sour Rib 糖醋排骨 $17.95 **\n＊Spiced Beef Shank 五香牛展 $13.95\n＊Salted Soy Bean Milk 鹹豆漿 $4.50\n\n- - - - - -\n\nAfter discovering this place, I will never spend an hour waiting for table at Nan Xiang anymore. Your mouth is ready to water over every dish here. They offer attractive dine-in promotion: If you spend over $10, you can enjoy Pork Soup Dumplings/Peking Duck Bun for free‼️ They also serve free Fermented Glutinous Rice Dumpling (酒釀丸子), which is a kind of sweet and mild-alcoholic dessert soup.\n\n＊ Fried Bean Gluten 烤麩 **\nYou can never go wrong with this cold appetizer at any Shanghainese restaurant.\n\n＊ Pan Fried Pork Bun 上海生煎包 **\nMy fav among all. The juicy ground pork was wrapped with a fluffy bun with a golden crispy bottom. They also spread some black sesame and chopped scallion on top, which further enhanced the complexity of flavors.\n\n＊ Pork Soup Dumpling 豫園小籠包\nArrived fresh out of the bamboo basket. Even though we got it for free, the taste and servings were still satisfactory. The wrapper was pretty thick, but the dumplings were enclosed with delicious broth and meat fillings.\n\n＊ Pan Fried Chives & Shrimp Dumplings 韭菜鮮蝦煎餃 **\nInside the crispy and chewy wrapper, they were filled with hearty shrimps and chives!\n\n＊ Pork Vegetable Wonton in Chilli Oil & Peanut Sauce 紅油抄手\nThe biggest Sichuan wontons I’ve ever seen! It was also my first time enjoying it with peanut butter sauce. What a pity that their chilli oil wasn’t spicy at all.\n\n＊ Sweet Soy Bean Milk 甜豆漿\n\nSkip:\n＊ Braised Fish 燻魚\nToo many fish bones.\n\n＊ Deep Fried Sesame Ball 芝麻球\nNth impressive. Just an ordinary fried sesame ball with red bean lotus filling.\n\nTheir service was prompt and welcoming. Our food came piping hot within 10 mins after we ordered, except the pan fried pork bun which took a bit longer. Our server was so humorous lol his dad jokes made our day."

            "text": "去吃了很多次了，才发现都没给上海豫园写过评价。他家的长岛和法拉盛店，都有消费满10送堂吃的小笼包的福利，昨天嘴馋点了烤鸭外面裹的包子皮，口感还可以，可能凉了点不够香酥。对好久不吃的脆口黄瓜很失望，尾巴居然每个都是微苦的，可惜了一整盘菜。某同学最喜欢他家的本帮烤子鱼，我也吃过几口，就是味道清甜的，烤的香酥的，有时候偏干，有时候刚好。老鸭粉丝汤最近感觉比之前好吃，鸭血嫩嫩的，粉丝也是好吃的，他家的汤里最喜欢这个汤，带点黑胡椒提味，很不错。之前也点过松鼠鳜鱼啦，猪蹄黄豆汤，虾饺皇，红烧牛肉面，糖醋排骨等等，这次试了海鲜炒年糕，口味偏咸甜，就是除了没有家常年糕的海鲜，其他口感啥的都还过得去。希望他的黄瓜不再是备菜的，现拍其实又不浪费黄瓜，又好吃…………有的图片很久了，就不发了～以后再补充。去他家主要也是喜欢那个小笼包的，每次都有餐后甜品酒酿丸子，好像也是最近感觉好吃了点，之前总觉得太黏糊……"

            "text": "餐廳用餐環境明亮乾淨，服務人員態度很和藹親切，不會催促點餐，上餐速度適中。\n\n甜豆漿蠻濃郁香甜；蝦仁腸粉有整顆整顆的蝦仁，搭配的醬汁不會過鹹；薺菜雲吞很大顆，湯很清淡但湯有點少；鮮竹卷的味道很好，有竹筍鮮味和腐皮的糯糯的口感，這道是今天最喜歡的；小籠湯包分別是純豬肉口味（贈送的）和絲瓜口味，剛上桌趁熱吃最好吃，冷掉後會有點豬腥味出現。純豬肉小籠包的比絲瓜口味好吃（其實吃不太出來絲瓜的味道，感覺絲瓜比例很少），然而小籠包的摺子太厚，不太喜歡那種口感。\n\n整體而言是不錯的餐廳，一個人自己來用餐也適合。"
