The first thing the waitress said to me was there is a 90-minute table time (I was not ordering the all-you-can-eat menu which I know has a 90-minute limit on time), so it was pretentious, unsettling and unnecessary to say that.  I order the $55 Wagyu.  It contains no sides so I ordered rice and broccoli with it.  The plate came with 7 small pieces of Wagyu, cut in irregular triangular bits which makes it hard to cook evenly.  One piece was so fatty and tough I could not chew it and has to spit it out."

They give you a lot of food for the price.  Rice, salad and soup comes with the meal.  You choose an appetizer, vegetable, combo set (protein) and dessert.  It's very filling.  We had the Eggroll and friend dumpling.  It was crispy, moist and hot.  The protein doesn't look like much but with everything else, it's enough.  Proteins were marinated.  Very easy to grill.  Everything was delicious.  Only disappointment was the s'mores.  It was hot enough I give good char marks on the marshmallow.  It couldn't melt the chocolate so it ended up dry.  It's seems to be a popular place because it fill up at noon. It's a nice lunch option."

The service was excellent—our servers were friendly, attentive, and kept everything moving at a great pace. Even with the 1 hour and 45 minute dining time limit, we never felt rushed. We had more than enough time to enjoy each course and even wrap up with dessert.\n\nWe ordered the Gyu-Kaku Feast, and the food was incredible. My personal favorites were the Yaki Shabu and the Harami Skirt Steak! Every item was fresh, well-seasoned, and arrived in a timely manner.\n\nThis was such a fun and memorable way to celebrate a special occasion. Gyu-Kaku absolutely delivered with delicious food, exceptional service, and a great atmosphere. We’ll definitely be back!"

Good thing we had a reservation. With that said, the servers did really well, not as attentive as they normally are but not bad considering the circumstances.\nThe food was still really good, they rearranged their menu a bit which made it much easier to understand, showing the upcharges better. Now we can see how four people ordering $20 lunch specials can walk out spending $170 not including tip LOL.\nI still say the bistro hanger steak is my favorite and I really enjoy their salad because the salad dressing is so good.\nOverall, a really enjoyable meal."

Tons of choices of appetizers, veggies, and juicy cuts of meat. The staffs here are super friendly, efficient, and on point with swapping out your grill when it gets too charred. One staff here, Ke, stands out outstandingly with his great smile, attentive service, and since the first date at Gyu Kaku years ago, he’s still here with the same energy. If you’re into bold flavors, their spicy sauce is straight up addictive. I could dip anything and everything in it. Their super fresh meats marinated to perfection unlocks all the umami magic once it hits that fiery grill. Save room for a slice of that Lady M which is like putting a cherry of top on a sundae. Come visit Gyu Kaku if you’re looking for some delicious BBQ!"

The food is delicious, fresh and their line of cocktails are great too.\n\nWe came in for my husbands birthday and enjoyed every minute of our dinner. Keep in mind to make reservations ahead of time, it is strongly recommended and they only have a 15 minute grade period to arrive. They will call you 10-15 mins ahead of time as a courtesy, which is great. Parking is very limited due to being smack in Main St -43- but there are parking garages around if you must drive. The LIRR is 2 minutes or less around the corner and plenty of busses and the 7 train if it doesn’t run into any issues.\n\nWe will definitely return here again to try the rest of the menu!\n\nEnjoy!"

The menu offered a wide variety of high-quality meats, seafood, and vegetables, all perfect for grilling to perfection right at our table.\n\nEach dish was bursting with flavor, showcasing the freshness and authenticity of the ingredients.

The combination of excellent service, inviting ambiance, and mouthwatering food made it a memorable evening that I can’t wait to repeat.

The bill can easily hit $400 for a group of 6 but it is worth all the money spent. The green tea crepe and the lava cake are probably my most favorite items on the menu.

I gave 4 stars because we had issues with the grill that our trainee waiter couldn't figure out. The food that was supposed to take 2-3 mins each took about 10-15 mins. Towards the end when we ordered dessert, another waiter came over and fixed it. We were compensated with money off the bill. Oh and let me not forget if you have 5 or more in your group, 20% gratuity will be added automatically. They received a nice $75 tip from our party of 6.

We ordered the Meat Lover's BBQ combo, as well as some pork belly, ramen, tuna poke nachos, and spicy tuna volcano. The food came quickly and were all delicious. When it came to grilling the meats, it didn't take long at all, and our waiter came by every 5 minutes to change the grill for us. The sauces were amazing as well. Finally, the s'mores for dessert was a really fun experience. The only downside of the restaurant is that it was a little expensive, but the price was comparable to most Korean BBQ restaurants that I've been to. If you get their app, then there are some rewards that you can redeem after acquiring points. Definitely would recommend this restaurant and come here again soon."

It's to be expected with an array of food selections that aren't over bearing when deciding on choices as well as friendly help from the staff. I can only say I'd recommend the packages and sit down, get ready to eat, and leave with a full belly."
