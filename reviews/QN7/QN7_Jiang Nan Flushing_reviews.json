Waste of money.  Seem like they do not know what salt is use for honestly 🤦🏻‍♂️ if u have no taste buds and want eat uncooked half raw meat this is the place for u 👍🏽"

Every dish was packed with flavor and made with so much care.\n\nBig shoutout to Manager Hanson for being incredibly kind with attentive service,\nwe felt very well taken care of!\n\nNow let’s talk about the food:\nThe Four Treasures Soup was rich and comforting with tons of ingredients, the kind of soup that warms your whole body.\n\nThe salted egg yolk shrimp was amazing, and pairing it with the crispy fried dough is genius.\nThe frog with garlic was super fragrant and tender highly recommend.\n\nThe smoked pork neck was flavorful and had the perfect bite (my husband couldn’t stop talking about this one 😂).\n\nMy personal favorite was the stir fried beef: spicy, fragrant, and very satisfying. Just a note: it’s not super tender beef, so if you prefer melt in your mouth texture, keep that in mind.\nWe finished with the mango pomelo sago which was refreshing and delicious!\n\nAlso got a passion fruit mojito: fruity, strong, and really refreshing.\n\nDefinitely coming back. Highly recommend for anyone craving authentic and flavorful Jiangnan cuisine!"

Ordering was easy with the tablet menu that has photos of each dish.\n\nWe tried the Dry Pot Cauliflower (spicy and flavorful), Braised Lion’s Head Meatballs (rich and savory, perfect with rice), Kimchi Cheese Fried Rice (so good!), Garlic Pork Slices with Cucumber (refreshing and delicious), Sweet Sticky Rice Stuffed Lotus Root (great texture), and Crab Roe Tofu (silky and beautiful).\n\nEvery dish looked amazing and tasted even better.

I ordered several dishes to try, and everything tasted just as good as the branch I had previously visited in Manhattan.\n\nThe Peking Duck is a must-try—absolutely delicious and something you shouldn’t miss.\n\nWhat made this location stand out, though, was the excellent service. Unlike the Manhattan branch, where the service can be a bit confusing and unorganized, the staff here were very attentive.\n\nIn particular, the manager—Hudson (apologies if I spelled the name wrong)—was outstanding. He made sure everything ran smoothly and took great care of the customers.\n\nOverall, the food was just as delicious as always, and the atmosphere at this branch is even better. There are more tables and space than the city location.\n\nThe only downside is the difficulty in finding parking—it’s quite challenging. I recommend taking the subway if you’re planning to visit. It’s very convenient, and the station is close by.\n\nAlso, this location is near Tangram Mall, so you can go for a nice walk or shopping after your meal."

Stopped by for a family dinner, super long wait though (could be from the extra crowd going to the blackpink concert), Peking duck wrap, cumin lamb on sizzling plate, stir fried string beans, sliced pork belly with garlic are good :)\n\nExpect a long wait for the seats, make a reservation before coming to save some wait time or else it could be 45 min to an hour especially for larger groups, 4 people is a better size, but with more people you can try more dishes. They use mini table for the waitlist.\n\nPrice is also a bit higher so more for special occasions and celebrations."

We were seated in the booths and  were given tablets with restaurant week menu, drink and dinner menus to order.  While we did saw some of great dishes, we decided to order from the dinner menu. For drinks, I ordered the pink passion while my girlfriend ordered the mojito I really liked mine as it was on the sweeter side and was pretty refreshing. While she did like her drink, she preferred the pink passion. We decided to order pork soup dumplings. It came with 4 and were quite large. The soup was very flavorful and rich and the pork was great. We decided in ordering the pecking duck and the sliced marble beef in golden pepper broth.  We also ordered the seafood fried rice. I can eat this all day. This was delightful. The duck itself was fresh, tender and was balanced with a sweet and savory sauce accompanied with a gorgeous presentation of the food. We were also recommended to combine all of the ingredients and can say it was really refreshing and  tasty. A combination of sweet and fresh! The sliced marbled beef in golden pepper was exactly what the waiter had warned. Spicy as hell. However, it was still delicious. Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend!"

            "text": "visited this restaurant today and was very disappointed with the experience, especially considering the high price point.\n\nWe ordered the whole roasted duck for $100, expecting something freshly made and served hot. Instead, it was clearly pre-cooked and reheated. The duck wasn’t even hot when it arrived, and within just five minutes, it was completely cold. The skin, which should have been crispy, was soft and soggy — a huge letdown.\n\nWhat was even more unacceptable was the presence of multiple fruit flies flying around the table. This is supposed to be a premium dining experience where we’re spending $70–$80 per person. Yet, we had to constantly wave our hands to keep insects from landing on our food. It was both unpleasant and unhygienic.\n\nAside from these issues, I will say that the other dishes we ordered tasted decent. But the quality of the duck and the fly problem completely ruined the experience for us. Definitely not worth the price."

So I believe the price is right and the quality it 5 out of 5. I also think this is a Michelin Star restaurant. I highly recommend it 👌"

It redefines what Chinese cuisine can be, stripping away the usual bold sauces to reveal the yin and yang of taste.\n\nThe abalone soup was a masterpiece.
