None of my party liked eating Tilapia and the server said we could opt to having Lapu-Lapu instead which was pretty cool. Good place to bring an older crowd of people if they want to experience an Asian experience in flushing"

            "text": "The only reason why I’m giving this place four stars and not five is because I spent the entire next day on the toilet. Most of the food was great. I just don’t think I have the stomach for it at my age anymore.. we got a bunch of food. Our favorite was the spicy shrimp and steak. The final meal we shared was the vermicelli noodles in red sauce , a little too weird for me. The soup dumplings were good, but nothing special. And the house fried rice was also solid but again nothing stand out. The service was very very good , plenty of servers and they were standing by for us the whole time with good water service too; and when it came time to finish up, they did not rush us out in anyway. If I could add some noodles to the menu I would. I also would change the physical menu entirely. They gave our party of four dudes two iPads to share, and the menu was glitchy at best. It was disorganized ,parts of it didn’t work and hard to find what you picked out to order when the waiter came. If I were to have one minute with the manager, I would say buy some regular menus or print paper ones every week and throw them away often. Or even do the barcode thing. Eating around this area of flushing we’ve seen some of the grossest menus I’ve witnessed worldwide. Having a gross, malfunctioning iPad put in your hands has taken it to the next level. I also feel like my five-year-old nephew could have designed the menu better. Last thing and this goes to all the restaurants. Wipe and clean the light switches and door handle areas. PLEASE!"

Every dish tasted very authentic and had just the right amount of spice and flavor. The standouts were the fried fish, braised pork, and cabbage, but all the dishes were great. This place is the perfect definition of authentic Chinese food in Flushing. I don’t remember the individual prices of each item, but the total came out to be around $27/person for a group 6. Overall, I would recommend if you are a fan of Sichuan food."

Cleanly, sleek, and the music wasn't loud, which for me is a big plus.\n\nThe server was very nice and made the whole experience very seamless.  We were given iPads to see what things on the menu looked!\n\nThe food was spectacular.  Delicious, with generous portions and reasonable prices.  I would suggest getting a couple big things among yourselves and sharing, with each person having a bowl of rice.\n\nGreat spot -- here's to many more visits, hopefully!"

            "text": "I recently visited Ally 41 in Flushing and was thoroughly impressed! As someone looking for vegetarian options, I was delighted with their offerings. The Mapo Tofu (vegetarian version) had perfectly soft tofu with a wonderful balance of leeks and spicy chili oil.\n\nTheir string beans were exceptionally fresh and perfectly salted - not sour like I've experienced at other restaurants. The real standout was their handmade noodles with sweet peanut sauce - these thick, inconsistently shaped noodles were so chewy they were almost \"dumpling-like\" in texture. Each bite was a joy!\n\nI appreciated the complimentary pickled vegetables that added just the right amount of acidity to balance the meal. The portions were generous, and the atmosphere was cozy with nice industrial elements like cement walls and metal accents.\n\nThe staff was courteous, and I found the digital menu with accurate pictures and translations very helpful. Even if you don't speak Chinese, ordering is a breeze. Simple dishes executed perfectly - that's what great Sichuan cuisine is all about! Will definitely be returning soon."

I tried the Szechuan slices beef, the noodle with minced meat, and the tofu with pork, and all of them were fantastic. Clearly, my eyes were bigger than my stomach could handle because I couldn’t finish half of it. I had to take them home, which I’m happy about for tomorrow. The food and service were both great. Highly recommend!"

I also saw that the restaurant had been featured in The New York Times, which added to my excitement.\n\nFrom the beginning, the service stood out. My server, Leon, politely asked whether I preferred a hot or cold drink instead of assuming I wanted hot tea, as is often the default in Chinese restaurants. This small but thoughtful detail showed real attentiveness.\n\nI ordered the stir-fried seasonal vegetable and the sautéed shredded potato with spicy. I also had many specific dietary requests: less oil, less salt, no MSG, and no soy sauce. To my delight, the kitchen honored all of them perfectly. I was genuinely impressed by the communication and teamwork between the server and the chef.\n\nAs a vegan diner, I found the experience not only satisfying but comforting in how my needs were respected. I highly recommend Alley 41 to anyone seeking delicious, authentic food with exceptional service—especially fellow vegans."
