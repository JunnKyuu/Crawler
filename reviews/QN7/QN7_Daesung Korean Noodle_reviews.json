Delicious Kalguksu (I opted for the spicy regular version and it was very very good) and huge servings at great prices.\n\nThe pickled ginger was good, but the kimchi is maybe the best I've had atca restaurant. I could tell that the jeons or pancakes were the thing to get, but I was solo so will have to wait for support to order that.\n\nService was efficient and good. I do mot think there was one table (it was pretty packed for a weekday afternoon) that wasn't filled with Koreans.\n\nCan't wait to return to try more items."

They waited a long time but it’s to be expected on a weekend. When it was almost their turn, the hostess asked if they would like to pick their food so that they could start their order. My parents had already picked their dishes and were about to be seated when a Korean couple walked into the restaurant and after speaking Korean to the staff, were given the table that was supposed to be for my parents. My mother confronted the staff and told them that this was not right. While the staff tried to ask the Korean couple to come back they had already sat down. My parents were given the next table, a 4 top instead. While they said the food was good, this treatment by the restaurant staff was unacceptable and ruined their experience. It’s one thing if my parents had waited outside and did not see them being skipped over, but my mom was sitting right next to the book and could clearly see that they were next and the staff still chose to seat the Korean couple before my parents. This restaurant does not treat all of their customers fairly and shows blatant favoritism to Korean customers. We will never visit this restaurant again."

I love that the silverware and napkins are available table side.\n\nThey give you a generous portion of kimchi and don't skimp on the refills. Their kimchi is definitely one of my favorites. I'd also like to note that they include a good portion with your meal - even if you're ordering takeout.\n\nI don't think you could go wrong with w any of their noodle dishes, but definitely try their seafood pancake. It's delicious!\n\nThis place is super busy on Saturdays so plan accordingly. Clean and spacious. I wish that they were open on Sundays."
