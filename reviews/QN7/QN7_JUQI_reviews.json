We were led to a bank section and offered a table with a cage theme but had to commit to spending $380. After we were seated we were given an iPad to order. Though once the items are selected, the summary page (checkout) isn't translated into English so we needed the staff to assist us to ensure we were ordering the right items and appropriate quantities. The food, was nicely plated but not very memorable. The seafood fried rice was too fishy for my taste. The duck was served in a tiered platter, it was very pretty. My favorite dish was the Kung pao chicken. I don't think I would return, given the challenges in seating and ordering."

The roast duck is exceptional—crispy skin, tender meat, and rich flavor—served thoughtfully with your choice of a light duck-bone soup or salt and pepper for crunchier bites. The fire black rice is another highlight, smoky and aromatic with perfect texture. Combined with JUQI’s lively yet refined atmosphere, it’s an excellent spot for an authentic and memorable Beijing meal."

            "text": "I was always intrigued by this restaurant whenever I visited Tangram and pass by so I finally decided to give them a try.\n\nFood:\nWe ordered a lot of dishes as it is for a family gathering. Essentially all of the dishes were amazingly prepared and well suited for our taste. Surprisingly, even though the Peking Duck is what this restaurant was known for, the highlight for us was actually the lamb ribs, it was incredibly tender and juicy with a nice light crispy shell and fragrant spicy kick. The sweet and sour squirrel fish was a close second - it was tangy and very appetizing. The beef with crispy mushrooms is a good runner-up. The mushroom was crunchy and fragrant, almost like a potato chip. The only disappointing dish was the leftover duck rack they fried with salt and pepper. Looks unappetizing and taste overly oily. Make it into a soup if you really want to make the best of your duck.\n\nService:\nService was mediocre, the servers were friendly but were hoping they are a bit more attentive. Dishes also came at weird intervals too. At one point there was a 20-25 minute gap with no new dishes coming in. Our only vegetable dish came in as one of the very last dish (mind you we ordered over 15).\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe surrounding makes me feel like I am back to China. I absolutely love the decor. We booked a private room and it was modern and sophisticated.\n\nPrice:\nAfter tax and 18% tips, we average about $95 per person. Mind you we ordered essentially most of their expensive signature dishes (except king crab) so the price is more reasonable than it seems.\n\nTLDR:\nFood was great, especially the lamb ribs, sweet and sour squirrel fish and beef with crispy mushrooms. Service was mediocre, the servers could be more attentive and dishes can come out in a more timely interval. Atmosphere is beautiful a it is like I stepped into a high end traditional restaurant in Beijing. The price is reasonable though can be a bit pricey depending on what you will be ordering.\n\nI honestly would skip the duck the next time I will be back. I find their smaller dishes way more appealing and flavorful."

            "text": "I have to say that after reading so many favorable reviews, and after traveling all the way to Flushing from central New Jersey, I was disappointed. The Peking Duck was good but not great. It was served somewhere between room temperature and cold, with more fat than I expected between the skin and meat. Our other two dishes (shrimp and eggplant) were quite good although quite sweet, which puzzles me. In China, none of the main dishes we enjoyed were sweet as so many seem to be here in Chinese restaurants at home. The service was at best indifferent, and the atmosphere lacked the charm and authenticity of so many restaurants I've visited in Flushing. The tranquility I would have expected from a restaurant that was sparsely populated in the early afternoon was marred by the incessant clatter of clean dishes and flatware being moved to and from a staging area that was right behind our table. Although we moved to another table, the incessant clatter continued through our meal. All in all perhaps I was a victim of my own expectations but I expected more given the ratings and prices."

We came as a party of 5 without reservations during lunch on a Sunday and were seated after a few minutes.\n\nEverything we ordered was delicious. The cabbage cold dish was probably the favorite of the table. The duck took a while to be served but it was worth the wait. While the food was delicious, the meal was expensive so be prepared to pay.\n\nUnfortunately we didn't get to try the uncanny little rabbit thing on the dessert menu. I will definitely be back to try it, and get more duck."

This is DEFINITELY a place to visit, and you will feel it once you go here.

Check out the cooler at the front with the ducks. Digital menu, and waitlist grows quickly (no reservations on weekends).\n\nDuck was overly crispy, dry, and the toast points with duck and caviar was overkill... caviar had more taste than the duck. The sauce was off, and while the show is interesting (cutting the duck, display, and the flaming fried rice), the food taste disappointed. Go for the show, but don't expect to have great food. The duck bones salted and fried was probably the best part of the meal. For $100, I've had much better, cheaper, Peking duck elsewhere in Flushing and Chinatown.\n\nService a bit spotty as they were busy."

This restaurant offers creative and delicious dishes that are full of surprises.\n\nThe lion’s head meatball soup served in an old-school enamel mug was both nostalgic and flavorful—the broth was rich, and the meatball was tender and juicy with fresh vegetables on top. The crispy fried tofu bites were perfectly seasoned, crunchy outside and soft inside—seriously addictive! The bunny-shaped dessert was adorable and detailed, and tasted just as good as it looked—a perfect treat for both the eyes and the taste buds. The flaming black rice dish was the highlight of the night. The dramatic tableside flame show created a great atmosphere, and the rice was flavorful and packed with ingredients.\n\nThe service was warm and attentive, making the whole dining experience even more enjoyable.

Crispy skin, tender meat, and expertly paired condiments made it the highlight of our meal—rich, flavorful, and beautifully executed.\nAs for the rest of the dishes, we found ourselves wanting a bit more. While the presentation was polished and the ingredients fresh, the flavors didn’t quite resonate with us. It’s clear that JUQI puts effort into offering an extensive menu, but for our tastes, the supporting cast couldn't match the duck’s star performance. The atmosphere is inviting and the service attentive, making it a pleasant spot overall. But if we return, it’ll be with a singular craving in mind: that irresistible Peking duck."

We got a private room, which was very quiet with an elevated rolling center (video below). The roast duck was so good we finished it so fast, and with the sauce and sides, it was even better. There was water and tea when we came, which was great because we didn’t have to wait for it. The table also had three small dishes of sides served only around a minute after sitting down. The spicy beef drenched with sauce (which came in about 15 minutes) was unbelievably good, with some green onions sprinkled on top. The sour fish soup had the perfect ratio between soup and fish, making it so good along with the flavor. Circling back to the roast duck (the best thing to get there, in my opinion), if u get a private room, they cut it perfectly right in front of you then serve it. The toppings included spring onion, cucumber, really delicious sauce, etc. The service was also amazing, and the waitress was really nice and helpful. I honestly love this place and would definitely come back."
