            "text": "This was my second visit because the food here is honestly amazing juicy, flavorful BBQ that I couldn’t stop thinking about after my first time. I even planned to come again soon for my birthday party because I loved it so much.\n\nBut this visit was a total disappointment because of the waitress named Yuxin who served me. From the moment I sat down, her attitude was cold and unfriendly. That annoyed expression the entire time. Every time I asked for something, she seemed irritated, like she didn’t want to deal with me at all.\n\nWhat made it worse was how completely different she acted toward the Chinese customers nearby.\n\nAnd when she brought the check, she even gave it to me with attitude, like she couldn’t wait for me to leave. It was the final touch on an already uncomfortable experience.\nI came here to enjoy good food not to feel ignored and uncomfortable. The kitchen deserves five stars but the service gets zero. I left feeling disappointed and honestly disrespected."

Shrimp and other seafood are fresh and bouncy. There are plenty of sauces and sides, the grill heat is steady, and the staff swap grates quickly. The classic Chinese-style interior is comfy and great for groups.\n\nValue is excellent: portions are generous and plates are big, so you don’t need to order a lot to leave full. Must-tries are the marbled beef slices and fattier cuts—best lightly grilled, then wrapped with crisp lettuce to balance the richness. Overall, tasty, great value, and I’ll definitely be back!"

The spicy cucumbers were a refreshing counterpoint to the fatty beef, and the seafood pancake was perfectly crispy. The only minor critique was that the seafood pancake dipping sauce was a bit too salty, so we ended up using the complimentary dipping sauces instead. Overall, a highly recommended and satisfying meal."

The staff are incredibly attentive and friendly, making sure your grill is always just right and your table never lacks for anything. The restaurant is clean, stylish, and has a lively yet relaxed vibe — perfect for both casual nights out and special gatherings.
