The manager from Hyatt recommended the happy hour Monday- Friday at 3-5 pm.\n\nThe roof top views & ambiance are 7 stars but everything else is below average.\n\nI enjoyed the $8 Cabernet but was disappointed by the $8 meatball (skimpy 3 pieces). The meatball & slider is on happy hour menu but no different in price from regular menu.\n\nHappy hour? I have had better sliders for $5 in Manhattan. And the meatballs are not even worth $3. This is Flushing right?\n\n4/7/24 update:\n\nSunday 7 pm and the bar & restaurant is counting sheep’s 🐑 . GHOST TOWN .\n\nTime to change the tune 🎶 or change management 😅😅\n\n8/1/24:\nService has improved lots 👍👍\n\n10/6/24:\nHappy Hour menu is removed.\nOnly 30% off cocktails. No wine or beer. 😤\n\n11/26/24.\nThe wine menu needs to be updated to reflect the price. The bartender had to call the GM for a price quote on a glass of Cabernet. Really? The red wine offerings are for tourists… 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️\n\nAlso, why have a bottle of empty Opus One on display if it’s not on the menu???\n\nSo far I’ve only tried the bar food. There is no incentive for me to actually dine here based on my many visits.\n\nHopefully this will change in 2025…\n\nFYI:\nA great steak house in Manhattan has 5,000 plus reviews. A good one in Queens or Long Island should have 1,000 reviews…\n\nOctober 2025:\nService has only degraded. After waiting 10 minutes at the bar to order a hanger steak & drink. No one was available so we walked out…"

            "text": "Speaking just about the food, I honestly didn’t find anything memorable. It was all pretty average. From the photos, what I remember is that the potatoes were cut too large, the macaroni felt a bit too heavy, and the steak was decent. But since it’s a steakhouse, I feel like that’s something they’re supposed to get right. One thing I really wasn’t a fan of was the drinks. Both cocktails I tried were poorly balanced and just didn’t taste good. The dessert was also too sweet for my liking.\nHowever, the restaurant has a nice atmosphere. The decor is elegant and makes it a good spot for a date. The Chinese server was also really attentive. He noticed I didn’t like the drinks and offered a complimentary dessert. If you go around sunset, the view from the terrace is also beautiful and you can catch some great evening skies. But one thing I’m sure of is that I won’t be coming back here to enjoy that sunset again."

            "text": "We visited Prime for the first time with great expectations, especially after speaking with the managers, who were very polite, and understanding. Unfortunately, our experience with our server, Shirley, was disappointing and not at all in line with what we expected.\n\nThroughout dinner, she was less than polite, not accommodating, and often absent or unreachable. Which honestly still would be okay if she had a better attitude. This experience was especially disheartening as we were celebrating a birthday. She never even brought the birthday guest his drink. It was awkwardness the whole evening and not welcoming.\n\nWe had a few additional members join us. We are gentle, understanding group, and we were perfectly fine if the restaurant couldn’t add more chairs to our table. They could sit separately and we would have happily enjoyed our evening regardless. However, Shirley handled the situation poorly—raising her voice at me in front of our party, ROLLING her neck, and speaking in a manner that felt unnecessarily abrasive and unprofessional. Even if the request could not be accommodated, there are much more courteous ways to communicate this but raising your voice and rolling your neck is not one of them. It was so awkward.\n\nOn the positive side, the food is good. The chef did a wonderful job, and both the bartender and the busser were far more attentive and helpful than our server, Shirley. Unfortunately, when the primary point of service is rude and unprofessional, it shifts the entire dining atmosphere and leaves guests feeling uncomfortable.\n\nWhile I truly wanted to love this place—and in many ways, the food and other staff made it bareable—our server’s attitude overshadowed the evening. We all wanted to leave. We are paying guests not a charity or a burden. I would not recommend this restaurant for anyone seeking warm, or pleasant service. The birthday guest is a shy quiet person and I specifically told her not to sing happy birthday but she still tried to slide it in there, so odd. Then it made the whole table want to sing after. A dining experience should make guests feel heard, valued, welcome, and unfortunately, that was not the case here. Also, pulling me to the side to speak about a $35.00 cake fee, I don't understand because our bill was over $1600.00 so why pull me aside to speak about $35.00 not sure if this was to cause embarrassment but it was just awkward. We do not recommend visiting this restaurant definitely not for anything special or important. You never know what you're going to get."

Amazing level in a surprising but logical location. Update 5/27/23 - service still very-very slow, especially on drinks. The food was slow to come out but even the slow appetizers were quicker than the drinks, which took about 20 minutes. Not the fault of the wait staff but they definitely need to hire a new bartender or hire 2 more if the bar is that slow, there's enough room for at least 4 bartenders. Also, understandably, at least a quarter to a third of the guests are IG / TikTok / other social media purpose guests, so the quality/variety of the food isn't the purpose of visiting, but perhaps some seasonal changes to the menu would be welcomed."

The hostess guided us to our table and handed us the menu while the server attending to us promptly showed up.\n\nWe received an assortment of breads not even 2 minutes after we placed our order. Bread was warm and delicious, and their herb butter was even better.\n\nGot the porter house Medium Rare, the chicken, green beans, fingerling potatoes and the asparagus side. The steak was perfectly cooked and rested. Roasted garlic on the side gave it a nice touch. The chicken was phenomenal, crispy, juicy, and the leaks and white bean puree paired perfectly with it. All 3 sides were amazing but the stand out was the asparagus. That bacon aioli is to die for. Overall the experience was great, my wife and I were blown away and will definitely be back."

            "text": "100 stars if I could! This lovely steakhouse has an amazing and attentive staff with the most wonderful services. Me, my fiancé and our child came here on a Saturday night and we were blown away by how amazing all the dishes tasted! You might come to a steakhouse just to get the steaks but here you can get everything else too. Few of the many appetizers we got were the roasted bone marrow, edamame, oysters, tomato and burrata, and the crispiest jumbo lump crab cake!\nAnd the sides to get with your main course (should be STEAK!!!) should be the lobster Mac and cheese, foraged mushrooms, cauliflower fried rice! I promise you won’t be disappointed with anything you get here :) me and my family definitely was very impressed with everything and happy with how delicious everything was!"

Tuna Tartare was good, needed some salt in my opinion. The steaks were just okay, not worth the price. Nothing special about it."

            "text": "A new restaurant with a great dining experience. The place is located in the rooftop (12th floor) and you get amazing skyline views as far as reaching Manhattan. It has a bar and dining areas, and overall it feels very cozy and warming. We went with the chief tasting menu, and almost all the dishes were perfect. Our favorite the lobster plate and the steak. The staff was polite and attentive, there’s parking underground and you need to enter through the 39th street. While the menu is a little bit pricey, I think it’s worth it and you’ll have a good experience. Perfect spot for dates, group of friends, celebration or just enjoying a cocktail while watching the sunset."

            "text": "A great place for a steak dinner! 4.5/5 stars tbh.\n\nThe aged porterhouse was fantastic. It was my first time having aged meat. It was more tender and had a \"cheesy\" flavor to it, which I really enjoyed. $135 for the meat (worth it I think).\n\nThe bone marrow was great. Paired with the spreads, it was a great start to the meal.\n\nThe garlic fried rice is superb. Rich in flavor. The Chinese sausage in the rice is always a great addition.\n\nThe Brussel Sprouts were my least favorite in the meal. A little too greasy and not enough crisp.\n\nService was excellent. We went on a Friday afternoon. Not busy.\n\nWould recommend!"

Crab cake was good too but wished there were 2. The Bourbon gives 2 with better price. The porterhouse is the better 1 than the filet mignon."
