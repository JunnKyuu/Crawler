We got the variety set, but probably would just buy individually and pick my favorites next time. It's honestly the most expensive Japanese menu I've experienced, which probably due to inflation and tariffs, so can't say whether that's normal in NYC or not, since I ate mostly Korean food while I was visiting."

I’m not sure if it was a heavy hand with the seasoning or just how it was marinated. The real highlight is the interior. The space is large with high ceilings, creating a comfortable and open atmosphere. The Japanese-inspired design is charming, and the lighting adds a warm and pleasant touch."

I really wanted to go into their private room with all the anime wallpaper but sadly two people can’t reserve it. This place is perfect for a relaxed night out. The wagyu was  delicious and cooked perfectly and full of flavor. It melted straight in my mouth. You can tell they really care about quality ingredient and they cook it in front of you. There’s three options for the seasoning of the wagyu. I also tried the dragon fruit drink (alcoholic) which was refreshing, beautifully presented, and surprisingly well-balanced. They also have a happy hour~"

Workers were probably thinking, “Again..?”\nSo I have been putting this place off because I thought it was kinda pricey but lemme tell you. Fantastic. The food here is great. I had the lunch omakase and the sweet potato ice cream for lunch. All were sooo good. I never had sweet potato with ice cream. I was put off but I’m glad I tried something new. Then in the evening I went for dinner with my loved one and he liked it as well. Cocktails 10/10 so flavorful. Green tea is good. Skewers. The matcha crepes. Oysters. Don’t even get me started on the atmosphere. It is like mini Kyoto or mini Japan. A lovely gem in Queens!"

This is definitely a great Japanese restaurant in the Flushing area to share with friends and family. Highly recommended!"

It's cleanly and the servers are responsive to the button that you press.\n\nThis place has excellent Yakitori (japanese shish kebab) I had the:\n1. Harami, it's beef and it was tender and juicy\n2. Butabara: Pork Belly, very good but I've had better pork belly elsewhere\n3. Negima: chicken thigh seasoned perfectly and tender\n\nAll were good and im glad I ordered.\n\nMain course: impossible Unadon, so very good and tender if you like grilled eel. It comes with folded egg on bottom, very filling.\n\nAll the foods were season well (delicious), savory and not overly salty. Im suprised that a place like this exists in flushing and not St. Marks.\n\nFor you drinkers, there's a really nice big open bar. PSA: Please drink responsibly, if you drink like a fish please Uber. Flushing does not need anymore bad drivers.\n\nThis place is a rare gem, if you like Japanese food you gotta come here, if not... then you will keep supporting mediocrity."

If you haven't had a chance to pay a visit to Japan, Izakaya Nana is a great local choice!\n\nWalking in, you are immediately placed in an atmosphere where it feels exactly as if you were in Tokyo, Japan. Each room is designed differently, so even if you went multiple times you'd have an entirely different atmospheric experience.\n\nI went with a bunch of friends and we all bought something different. My personal favorite was the Impossible Unadon; an 8oz eel over tamago and rice. It was incredibly filling and delicious, very well worth the $34.99 for the dish.\n\nEvery item on the menu feels like you are getting what you paid for, with no shortage of quality or quantity.\n\nThe service was remarkable; press a button and they shall appear. Each server was friendly and made sure you were taken care of. They'd go over your items to make sure you received everything you ordered.\n\nI wouldn't think twice about coming back here, as Izakaya Nana really scratches that itch that makes me miss my visit to Japan."

The atmosphere is gorgeous,  it feels like you’re stepping into another world when you walk in and see the Japanese themed interior. Not an affordable place if you’re on a budget but a good place if you’re solo or a couple. Food was absolutely delicious, I got the Katsu Curry while my sister got the Tonkatsu Ramen. Both meals were cooked well and brought out in under 20 minutes after ordering. Wet wipes and water was provided to you as you are seated. Service was incredibly fast, we never waited longer than 1 minute to be helped. Overall an amazing experience."

The bar is pretty big with a cool design inside. We had a table so we had a call button to use whenever we wanted to order and they came right away.\n\nWe started with a house hot sake, yellowtail carpaccio, and 2 items off what seemed like a limited time menu the beef miyoshi and spiced cucumbers. The fish was really fresh and tasted great, the beef and cucumbers were super tasty.\n\nWe switched over to house cold sake and ordered the oysters which come with uni and ikura on top, and got the small order of wagyu and a waiter came to the table with a hot stone and grilled it for us. All of it was great and the house sakes are very good for the price.\n\nWe then ordered some yakitori, shishito peppers, scallops, eel, pork belly, and steak, and the delicious brussels sprout tempura. The pork belly and steak were really good. We tried the matcha crepe cake and the taiyaki desserts, the taiyaki was the winner for us.\n\nOverall some really great food that was tasty and fun to eat. The house sake was really good too. Looking forward to coming back with more people"
