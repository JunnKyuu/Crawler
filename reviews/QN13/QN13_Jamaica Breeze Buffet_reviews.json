The stew was extremely salty not even a drunkard would've eaten it.I took it back in hopes of getting something else for my $11.54 I paid in cash.I was asked for a receipt which I did not keep and was told there's nothing that can be done without a receipt.The receipt and gloves were thrown in the garbage as I left not knowing the horrible food would be a waste of my money.I'll go across the street to Ralph's where the food it not reheated and sold as fresh."

I shared food and didn’t realize until I was eating the food that the chicken still had feathers on it, mainly because it was a cover in sauce. That made me nauseous once I seen it, almost threw up. Who’s to say the chicken was cleaned properly?! This establishment needs people who would like to be at work or at least somewhat friendly to customers. Service is so minimum but yet disgusting, similar if not a little worst than the food preparations.

            "text": "If zero stars was possible!!! The owner of this business she always have an attitude when someone ask her something. The first time my mother and I went my mother just asked why is she being charge so much if it’s buffets style meaning you could get whatever you want for a certain price but NO she charge extra for more than one choice of meat and she said you have to get a meal so it’s not a buffet style it’s pretty much serve yourself. Now today we go get lunch and my mother wanted to use her card. The lady who was ringing us out  said the charge have to be $10 on a card my mother food came up to $9.21 and before my mother was never told it had to be $10 to charge her card. So the lady told the owner and the owner started to get loud while explaining that it has to be $10 on the card and pointing to a sign that’s ripped up 🤦🏾‍♀️ We continue to make the purchase and the owner is rolling her eyes so I took my mother card out the machine and told her to have a nice day because as an owner you need to set the example for your staff and being nasty to your customers is not the way. As we walked away she started to talk about us with her staff and another customer. Which is really unprofessional and rude. I will never eat here again and this is why you can’t support black businesses because the owner always have an attitude with the people who support them to keep the lights on. Plus the food looked dry and not good at all."

Its self serve and they provide gloves for you to use prior to serving yourself. I've been eating here for the last 3 months, food is good. My only complaint is the oxtail and goat are not trimmed before cooking, but other than that..best spot for jamaican food out here"

I’m giving 3 stars because they did way better in the past. Also , I don’t like how the employees stare you down while you make your plate."

I just left there, and I was charged $16. and some change for 3 pieces of curry chicken, a small portion of white rice topped with stew peas, a small portion of mixed vegetables and 2 shrimp and the women behind the counter said I have more meat in my plate than anything else, my niece who was with me had 4 pieces of curry chicken and some rice and peas and her meal only came up to $6. and change. This business should really specify how they charge...is it by weight or what you have in your plate?! The cost is really at their discretion, so I would be mindful of this. I really should've just left the plate on the counter and walked out! I also noticed that a customer beside me..had a plate full of oxtail and rice and his order came up to $10 and change...since when is beef less expensive than chicken??? Smh."

            "text": "Recently found out by accident that Jamaica Breeze charges your credit card a higher amount than it shows on the itemized register receipt given to the customer!  The itemized register receipt given to the customer will say “cash” (even though credit card was used),  but the amount they run through the credit card machine includes a 3% “service charge” you don’t know about - until after the sale is completed (if you catch it/notice the price difference later).  While I was still in the store, I received a notification on my Apple watch about the transaction & noticed the amount was higher than the receipt given to me.  When I asked about it, I was told they keep the receipt that shows the extra charge.  WTH!!!  I asked for the manager.  While waiting on the side for the manager, I noticed a tiny sign not in a conspicuous location that said a 3% service charge is added to “all transactions” - but it’s actually added only to credit card transactions.  The manager refused to let me take a picture of the sale receipt that showed the higher amount charged to my credit card; manager also took my itemized receipt that showed the lower amount and refused to give it back to me after I asked her to return it to me.  BEWARE OF THIS!\n\nReceipt given to customer should reflect total amount charged to credit card and there should be a big sign in a very conspicuous place informing customers of this!!  I decided to check my other receipts when I got home and found out that had happened before but I didn’t catch it.  Unfortunately I don’t have all my receipts from other past purchases to see how far back this deception has been going on.  The tiny sign has not always been there.\n\nI don’t have a problem paying a reasonable service fee sometimes for using my credit card if I’m aware of the policy and decide at the moment I will pay with a credit card because I don’t have enough cash - but it should be a decision I make based on the policy I’m made aware of.  If I was aware on the day I discovered what was being done, I would have paid with cash.  The food (which is good) is pricey enough without having to also pay a service charge!\n\nI won’t be going back to Jamaica Breeze - not because of the service charge policy, but because of the deception and the manager refusing to give me back my receipt with the lower amount and refusing to let me take a picture of the store receipt that had the higher amount!  Why not??  I was a loyal customer for a long while - but it goes both ways.  I don’t like being deceived or handled in the way I was when I asked for original sale receipts."
