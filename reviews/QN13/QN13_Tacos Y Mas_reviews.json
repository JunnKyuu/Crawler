Had to wait almost 40 minutes for the food after being told that I would only need to wait 15 minutes. As I sat waiting,  I was watching the cooks make my order fresh down to boiling the water for the rice. There was food out that was already cooked and looked as if they let the grease get cold based on the oily appearance. When people ordered, i watched the cooks pick up the items and place them into the microwave to re-heat. When I finally walked over to the cashier for the third time, I received my food with an attitude and no apology for the wait. Meanwhile, I am seeing him be so gracious and courteous to all the Spanish clients. I will never go back."

They know I eat there often and upon messing up my food today, I requested some type of compensation for their wrongdoings. The man on the phone, not only said that I wouldn’t be compensated but if I did in fact want my money back I would have to return the food. My only options were wait an extra 30 minutes on top of the hour I just waited for the food OR give the food back and still wait for my money back. I decided I would return the food and it is now almost 2 hours since I first placed the order and no one has come to refund me. I love the food which is why I was a regular but the disrespect to a loyal customer was ridiculous. Will not be ordering from here anymore."

But today, I went inside to place an order. Moments later, two Hispanic women entered the restaurant and the cashier’s attention immediately went to them, as I stood there at the register waiting for him to place my order. He comes back to the register and begins taking their order, as I stand directly in front of him waiting to place mine. When the women finished placing their order, I confronted him about it, and he did take accountability. Ultimately, I left without placing an order because I refuse to patronize a business that does not value every customer, regardless of their ethnicity."

When I went in there, the service was pretty good and all the staff were super friendly and even gave me and my friend a piece of candy before we walked out the door (it was really gross and we spit it out but that’s not the point). Might wanna ask to hold the flies though when it comes to dining in. They’re everywhere and you might as well take it to go."

Solo que no deverian bajar ni en calidad ni en comida... los tacos ya no son de asada sino de carne sancichada sin sabor ni cebollani cilantro tortilla calentada en el microondas q ni le matan lo helado... recientemente ordene pollo asado me lo mandaron al carbon quemado... y repito no hay dia en la semana q no ordene comoda aqui.. siempre piden q devuelvas lo q no te gusta sin tocaro morder ... y ponen tantos peros...la carne asada es carne de milanesa  toda reseca...el higado es mas tomate y cebolla sin sabor... lo recomiendo Si... porque no todos los dias son malos .. pero eso de precios justos no son buenos porque es cierto todo esta elevado pero ellos disminuyeron la cantidad y calidad .... y aumentaron el precio..espero que Victor y su esposa lean los comentarios y quejas... porque mensajes no contestan ..ycomo clienta  segun ellos tengo preferencia.."

THEY ARE NOTHING BUT THIEVES!\n\nI've been ordering deliveries from here for over two years now and haven't had a problem until now.\n\nI called in my order, told them exactly where I lived TWICE and everything was fine. But after waiting over an hour for my order to come, I gave them a call only to have the owner tell me that they don't deliver to where I lived and that they are too busy to deal with me. Are you kidding me?\n\nI wouldn't be so angry if it wasn't for the fact that I had already PAID for the order with my debit card. I can see the transaction and they've charged me for the food already. I asked for a refund and they told me I would have to go into the store even though they are closing in 5 minutes and hung up on me immediately after that.\n\nI've been calling them back but they repeatedly decline my calls and I'm sitting here with NO FOOD & OUT $50."
