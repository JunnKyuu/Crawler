That is completely unsanitary and unacceptable. When I went back again, they were rude, though they eventually refunded me. This is completely unsanitary and unacceptable for any restaurant. You can see in the picture where my fries are missing from\nThe side and the top!! I did not touch them this how they gave it to me. DISGUSTING And the man in the picture is the one who took my fries out with his hands and gave it back to me.\n\nI will never eat here again, and I’m reporting this to the health department!!"
