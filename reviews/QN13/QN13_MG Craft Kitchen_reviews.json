The owner, I believe, answered the phone, and their customer service was excellent. They even included extra sauces, which everyone loved. We will definitely be coming back, and our office has shared many praises about the experience."

The menu has a bunch of good choices but not overwhelming. The food is pretty good. I noticed a lot of sweeter sauces on the meats as well as maple syrup in a couple of the dishes. If you like a little sweetness to your chicken and meat this is a really good spot."
