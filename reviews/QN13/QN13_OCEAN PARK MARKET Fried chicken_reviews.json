They didn't have the first two things we tried to order but eventually we did get a pretty good burger and a really good turkey club sandwich. Good portions, nice variety of other market goods, and friendly people. You can park for a bit close to the store and picnic down at the beach (but don't stay too long LOL). There is no seating inside or restrooms. There are public restrooms and tables near the beach."
