And of course the food is tasty and fresh.\nMy son had the crabcakes and drank a pina colada ( yes! They have smoothies too) while waiting for his order.\nThe drink was soooo good we bought another one.\nThey also have fresh coconuts to drink for my healthy foodies.\n\nThank you for keeping this neighborhood staple alive.\nSee you again soon."
