Looking forward to trying other items. I ordered on Uber Eats.\n\nUpdate:\n\nWhat a difference a day makes. Ordered again on 9/28, and the preparation was 3 stars at best. The Sunday crew needs to keep up the standard. Will order again. Hopefully it's an isolated incident."

I go inside koris I never been to this restaurant before so I’m trying to figure out what to get how to order. One their staff not very welcoming and when ordering I see prices on the menu and they are telling me I can’t order small sizes on the menu it says small sizes. I order wings and 2 sides Mac and cheese and yams which were two small sides food comes out to $30 insannnnneeee!! I pay it not complaining because I’m thinking in my mind it should be great for this price! The food was disgusting!!! The Mac and cheese was so dry like it had been sitting out all day the yams were bland the wings were ok! Never going here again they staff was not helpful what so ever!!!"

I asked her for something to substitute the two, and she said no, that’s all you get . She was not helpful , not nice and very dismissive . I would NEVER come here ever again.

The pasta looked destroyed and I couldn’t enjoy eating it without biting into pieces of chicken bones and skin. I also ordered bbq chicken but was called bc they didn’t have any, so I said ok to the jerk chicken yet the white rice I ordered, was changed without asking to rice and peas. This isn’t the first time the PRICE doesn’t match QUALITY. It’s the only place in the blocks radius that sells hot food but I’m not spending a dime in there anymore. You don’t know what you’ll get, will it be fresh or have sat there? You take a gamble when ordering. I spent 60$ for what? the size plates are too pricey for what you get. The only saving grace is that we crave jerk chicken and there are no other options for that,  yet."

They are behind a tall window, so it's hard to hear. We had to repeat what we wanted 3 times. In 10 or 15 minutes later, another lady called out a number, made eye contact with me, and lifted the bag, and since I wasn't given a number, I took it and sat down. We pulled everything out of the bag to find an order of chicken strips & waffles and an order of wings & waffles. They were busy, I didn't want to complain, and I didn't want to wait another 10 minutes for my burger & fries. I also wouldn't think the health department would approve of them giving the food to someone else since we had opened everything at our table. After we started eating, a girl came in to pick up her order. The woman who gave us the bag of food realized she had given us that girls' order DEMANDED that we pay the difference of the orders. NEVER in my 69-plus years of life has someone given me a wrong order and even hinted that I should pay the difference. It wasn't like I had gotten an order for 3, 4, or more people. 2 people 2 orders. I had to wait for her to take orders from 3 more people  before I could pay her. It is somewhat of a shady area, so I wasn't about to walk out. On top of this, 95% of gas stations that sell chicken strips most likely have better chicken strips than Kori's. The food was bad enough to never go back, but the service was worse."

If you can't afford to sell it and give ppl what they pay for please take it off the menu.I purchased the stew peas and white rice meal. It was not at all tasty. Plus the quality or content of the food did not measure up. It was not authentic stew peas and rice. It was more like rice and beans with a little seasoned meat . Turkey necks that were boiled out and 1 oxtail to be exact. If you are not willing to give ppl a decent plate of food. Don't take their decent money. I didn't give you 80% of what you charged. Or 75%. I paid you 100% of the $18.95 you charged for a medium size container of rice and beans. That was not authentic Jamaican stew peas. I could have gotten white rice and red beans from any Spanish restaurant for way less. I decide to make this review bc this is my second purchase that I was deceived by this establishment. The first was the bun and cheese. For a bun and cheese sandwich I expect authentic Jamaican cheese. The cheese was propped up to give the illusion of a complete slice, however it was not . It did not cover the bun nor was it Jamaican cheese. Again, I could have gotten regular cheese anywhere else. This is just wrong. Don't  believe I'll return . NOT Authentic Jamaican food in my opinion. Always aim to please, not deceive. The worst feeling in the world is not getting what you paid for. It's a form of extraction or thievery so to speak."
