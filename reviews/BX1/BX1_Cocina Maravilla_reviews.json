            "text": "Tonight I went after visiting another Mexican Restaurant nearby that did not have what I wanted on the menu available. Also they were open! The prices were much affordable than the other option, and I decided to get a Torta, for $10.50, Tinga De Pollo. It was very good, and so was the service, My Waitress was appropriate and gave Me friendly smile while serving :) I also got a drink, Vida Verde. The bar area was really cute, it would be nice if they had bar seating. When I got the bill My Waitress gave Me two pieces of my favorite candy and flavor! I was so happy and told Her, and She brought Me a handful I could eat while walking home! I was very grateful and appreciative."
