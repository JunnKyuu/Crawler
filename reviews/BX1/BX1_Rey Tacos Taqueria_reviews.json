Me enteré de que la persona que tomó mi orden no estaba ahí trabajando, sino que era un centro de llamadas.La persona fue muy amable, pero me hubiera gustado que estuviera en el lugar para que indicara cómo quería mi pedido a las personas que están realizando los pedidos. Fui a recoger mi orden, pregunté por los detalles de mi pedido y no sabían con exactitud cómo hacerlo. Cuando llegué a mi casa para degustar la comida y ver si mi pedido estaba correcto, me di cuenta de que no. Yo pedí dos tortas de birria y una orden de tacos de birria, y en vez de eso me dieron tres tortas de birria. Bueno, dije, no hay mucho problema con eso.Pero entonces mi esposa pidió unos tacos de pastor y no tenían sabor, y el cilantro que le pusieron no era muy fresco que digamos. También yo pedí unos tacos placeros: uno de chorizo con papas no estuvo tan mal, y otro de chile relleno, pero estuvo espantoso. El chile se veía que no era de hoy ni de ayer. Cuando lo asaron, se les pasó y lo quemaron, pero aún así lo usaron. Y para terminar, en la página algunos precios cambian. Por ejemplo, los tacos placeros cuestan $5.99 y me cobraron $7.99, y los tacos birria cuestan $15.99 y me cobraron $17.99. De todos modos, no los recibí porque recibí una torta birria que cuesta $13.99. Espero que mejoren porque son nuevos en el vecindario."

I chose the Burrito combo since it came with fries and drink, and I gotta say that burrito was insanely good, the meat was very tender, the rice and beans complimented well with the meat, and the cheese and sour cream on top added flavor. And the fries were pretty crispy and nicely salted. Would order from them again and try some of their other dishes."

I was just patiently waiting for them to finish and when I finally got to try it out, it did not disappoint. The food is 100% traditional. And super delicious and fresh they make it right there for you. The customer service was incredible. They have a very large crew, so you won’t be waiting long. They take takeout, delivery and dine-in. And the best part is the price for everything is very affordable.\n\nFor my first time ordering I ordered a flour Chicken quesadilla combo (comes w/ drink) for $11.99\nTacos Dorados En vase Combo (comes w/ drink) for $13.99\nAnd I also got to try their Nachos (comes w/ drink), you can choose how you want it. For just $13.49\n\nIf you live in the Bronx and you want to try a new authentic Mexican restaurant, you should try this one. This is your sign☝️"

Beef (carne asada) tacos are exceptional...lean & tasty, expertly cooked beef arrives on your plate piping hot.  But all of the tacos are very good.\n\nThis place is spotless and clean, covered in white ceramic tile like a Mexican marketplace.  It's fun to eat in at the counters.\nWe haven't ordered for takeout or delivery as yet."
