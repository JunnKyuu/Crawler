            "text": "Five minutes into Anasazi Steakhouse in St. George, I realized I hadn’t just walked into a restaurant, I’d entered a dimension.\n\nThe hostess greeted me with a smile that hinted she’d seen time bend before. My steak came raw, resting beside a glowing black slab hotter than a thousand suns, as if forged by the ghost of a cowboy who got too close to Zion’s red cliffs.\n\nI cooked it myself while whispering compliments to the sizzling rock, which might’ve whispered back.\n\nHalfway through, the air smelled like pure destiny and a faint trace of sandalwood, possibly from the neighboring table’s ribeye séance.\n\nMy mashed potatoes were so buttery they slipped off the plate and tried to apply for citizenship in another realm.\n\nA server named Gary (or was it Gandalf?) brought molten chocolate fondue that felt like it could heal heartbreak and ignite car alarms.\n\nBy dessert, I’d accepted that this place wasn’t just dinner, it was a ritual. If you stare long enough into your own reflection in the fondue pot, you’ll see your true steak-loving self smiling back.\n\n“Steak so good it made my ancestors text me.” - Bill Burr, probably."

Ordered then they came back 15 minutes later and said they are out. Reordered and the potatoes and vegetables were cold. The steak was average. The service was horrible there i said it again. Older lady and she hated her job. My son ask what type of salad dressings do you have. She replied the common ones. In 60 years I have never heard this before. We won’t go back and wouldn’t recommend especially for the price."

If bread could sigh, these were doing it.\n\nThe steak I ordered medium well arrived rare, so rare, I half expected it to introduce itself and ask me to stop cutting into it.\n\nThe shrimp, on the other hand, got the opposite treatment: overcooked and seasoned like the chef personally went snorkeling to bring back every grain of salt from the ocean.\n\nThe scallops? Let’s just say they spent a little too much quality time on the grill. By the time they reached me, all I could taste was char, as if the chef had forgotten them while catching up on a Netflix series.\n\nService and presentation were fine, but the food felt like a rehearsal dinner, lots of effort, not much polish. For the prices, I expected a culinary symphony. Instead, I got a garage band that hadn’t practiced.\n\nAll in all, the evening was certainly memorable and full of surprises. A few dishes wandered off-script, but unfortunately, not in a way that makes me eager for the sequel. St. George has too many great restaurants to roll the dice here again.\nso I’ll leave this one off my recommendation list."

It's a nice new building everything's pretty and unique. Right atmosphere inside. Induction stove top built into each table for the multitude of fondue choices.\n\nAmongst us we had fillets and ribeyes. Unique about this place is they will bring you a hot lava stone and you can cook your steak at your table how you like. Or they will cook it for you if you'd rather.\n\nServers were friendly and things moved along quickly. The fondue was really good with a selection of Breads and vegetables and fruits to dip. The cuts of meat were good and not overly seasoned. All in all I would definitely go back again. You're going to spend about $60 to $75 per person."

She went the extra length sitting down with me to go through the menu. Her recommendation was flat iron steak. It was not only cooked perfectly to my liking (medium), but also so well-seasoned that dipping into the steak sauce would be unnecessary. It was a rare occasion that I did not even throw a small chunk of meat away (seamless cut and chew). I didn't expect MJ to prepare the fondue for me (dark chocolate). The plate was overloaded with sweets and fruits. It goes without saying that I took half for breakfast. The walls are decorated with paintings and photography showcasing Utah's rocks and wildlife. Definitely come and try it for yourself if you have the chance to spend a night in St. George. Be warned, come for the steak and you will smell as such 😉."

The other/small party side of the restaurant appeared a little nicer at a glance.\nThe prices are a little high compared to the quality of the food, however, it probably has more to do with the unique menu of fondue options and the HOT STONE every entre can come with where you get to cook your meat to your liking.\nIt is nice that you can opt for the stone or the kitchen will cook your meat if you don't want the \"do it yourself\" experience.\nTowards the end of the meal I began to notice all the smoke/steam in the room from all the individuals cooking their meat. Didn't bother me too much but it encouraged me not to linger after dinner and our clothes and jackets still smelled like meat the next day.\nAll in all, I enjoyed the experience. But I don't believe I'll be back unless I bring grandkids or someone I think would get a kick out of cooking their own meat.\nI do recommend sharing if you go so you can taste and try many things.\n4 of us shared 1 fondue, 2 entrés and a fondue dessert. It was more than enough. We upgraded the 2 salads that come with the meal. I will say their Caesar salad was probably my favorite part and it was plenty for 2 of us. We had the California dreaming fondue. I didn't think it was cheesy enough and preferred our other friends' pretzel and cheese fondue. My friend preferred ours because she doesn't like cheese. Request rolls!!! We thought they just bring them, but apparently not.\nRib eye and chicken were alright. Shrimp 👍🏻. The rosemary garlic mashed potatoes were good but cold so I threw them on my hot stone. Loved their sweet carrots! We had the caramel chocolate fondue. That was really good but not enough items to dip and finished. If only we had a spoon, we would have scraped the bowl! They do serve fish, btw."

He answered our questions and I was pleased to be informed. Mark is very jovial and very funny. He pours a strong drink with a specialty he creates. The menu was delicious, with many different cheese choices of Fondue appetizer and a 🔥HOT Rock to cook your personalized entrée meat choice.

My husband ordered the Porterhouse & its was the thinnest Porterhouse we’ve ever seen. I ordered the New York strip. Both steaks were tough, overcooked & not quality meats. Served a very small salad to start. Steaks were accompanied by a small scoop of mashed potatoes & carrots. We noticed others around us getting some kind of bread w/ their salads but we did not. I asked about it & our server said it was on a “ask basis”. We questioned what that meant & she said people that come regularly know to ask. But since she knew this was our first visit, I asked, how would we know that?! And how expensive could a roll be with the prices they charge for their meals! Maybe they should try even Texas Roadhouse’s generosity with rolls! Won’t be back & definitely won’t recommended."

Great cooks, great cuts, and great food. Very well done 4.8/5.\n\nBefore we get into the steaks, I will be a little opposite of most reviews and even the \"specialty reason\" people go to Anasazi. I actually do not recommend the Hot Stone cook, but if you want the experience please don't let me deter you! The only reason I say this is that most people we have seen get the stone overcook their steak fast, discard a lot of it, and it just can not get the same flavor as a char-grilled steak. It's very cool, and a very fun option, but for the quality of local sourced, grass-fed meat you get and pay for, I'll let the pros in the back grill!\n\nI was fortunate enough to be able to have the special 30 Day Dry-Aged New York this trip. The size of the strip was fantastic, the seasoning was great, but the cook was one of the best medium-rares I have ever seen on a steak. Grill marks were perfect, and it is all Fire Char-Grilled, which you just can not beat the flavor that they grill that in. The umami flavor, the freshness, the cook was just incredible. We also ordered the regular New York, and it was just a great beef flavor, so well seasoned, and a good tender/fat ratio. One of my favorite parts was the Pesto-Cilatro Scallops appetizer. The sauce was so robust and flavorful, so fresh, and the scallops again perfectly cooked. I would get it if I were you every time! The sides are good, nothing special, and very small portioned, but you do want the steak to be the best thing on that plate in the end. The price does justify the steaks, but again, the sides could be elevated to get that perfect 5 stars. Service was also good. Great job, we'll be back!"
