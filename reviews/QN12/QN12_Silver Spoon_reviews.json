Unfortunately, their behavior is consistently unpleasant and makes the shopping experience uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the older woman who works here is always professional, pleasant, and respectful. She represents your business very well.\n\nIf this continues, you risk losing loyal customers like myself, as many people will not want to return to a place where they feel disrespected. I hope you take this matter seriously and address the attitudes of the younger employees before it affects your business further."
