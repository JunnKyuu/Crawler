What's disappointing is that this order couldn't even be shared with two people; that's how small the portion was. I was extremely excited to try this place. The food does have flavors, but the portion is a no-go."

The spice levels are just right, you can choose from lemon & herb to NAGA depending on your taste. Their wings, burgers, and platters are all delicious, and everything tastes fresh. The staff is friendly and the place is super clean. Definitely one of the best spots in Queens for halal grilled food. Highly recommend!"

From the moment I stepped in, the atmosphere was inviting—and the aromas of rich, spicy peri-peri coated everything in warmth.\n\nI tried their Honey Garlic Lemon Pepper Wings, the Grilled Chicken Platter, and the signature Peri Peri Burger—each dish was vibrant, flavorful, and made with care. The chicken, marinated just right, had that perfect blend of spice and juiciness, and the variety on the menu (wings, platters, wraps, burgers, and more) kept every bite exciting"
