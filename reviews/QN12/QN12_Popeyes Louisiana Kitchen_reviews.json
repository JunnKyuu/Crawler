And if that one girl isn’t there, the service is terrible. It is almost as if she knows everyone’s order. As far as upon entry there’s rarely ever chicken ready to be served. Services very slow. Most time you have to wait time could sit for 10 minutes or More. Me being totally honest, I don’t even think that the staff is following the directions on the preparation of the chicken. It just doesn’t even taste the same. The chicken is giving as many stars and as much energy as the staff is giving, which is very lackluster. I wish this Popeyes could do better.

After picking it up and heading to my car, I noticed that they hadn’t given me the sauce or a spoon for the potatoes. I also tried the tea, and it was absolutely disgusting. It tasted like it had gone bad, and I’m not sure if it was expired or if they weren’t cleaning it properly. I had to throw it out entirely.\n\nTo make matters worse, they had placed the extra fries I ordered with the chicken. My friend eats halal, so she couldn’t even have them. She went back inside to request the sauce, spoon, and to let them know about the issues. The woman behind the counter, who was wearing a hijab, was rude and didn’t say anything. She didn’t even offer to replace the fries or the drink. When she did speak, she blamed the mistake on the combo, even though the fries weren’t included in the combo at all. Was so upset with everything I couldn’t even my meal.\n\nThis experience was very disappointing. I won’t be coming back, and I think the employees need to do a better job of fulfilling orders and providing good customer service"
